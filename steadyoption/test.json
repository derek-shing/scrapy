You will NOT get a notification when it is updated, so there is no need to follow it. The Open Trades is usually updated by the end of the day. The SteadyOptions Trades forum is dedicated to posting our trades. You need to follow that forum to get trade notifications. There will be a separate topic for each trade. We will post our fills for entry and exit. We will discuss the trades in the Trades Discussions sub forum. The Open Trades are usually pinned on the top of the Trades forum. We will provide my exit guidelines and profit targets, but we encourage you to do your own homework before following any of my trades. Please set your own profit targets and follow them. I recommend reading the SteadyOptions strategies post to get more details about the strategies we use. If you want to get notifications about the trades, you should follow this forum. If you do so, you will receive an email when a new topic (trade) is posted. If you want to follow that trade, you will have to follow that specific topic in order to get notifications about the new posts in that topic We are also sharing the trades on a protected account @SteadyOptions . Request to follow this account if you want to get tweets about new trades. The trade alerts include a recommended number of contracts, based on a $10k portfolio.
