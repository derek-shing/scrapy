Why do you wish to be a member of Acupuncture?  \n \nI was informed of the vacancy by Dr. McMenemy and felt that I would be an asset to the Board.  In my opinion, being a volunteer is one of the best things \nthat one can do for your community.  Volunteers provide an innumerable \nnumber of h ours that greatly en hance our community . \n \n2. What do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of \nthe Acupunc ture? \n To review proposed related legislation and develop responses either pro or con \nand propose revisions/changes.  \nTo review applications to practice  Acupuncture  and approve if requirements \nare met.  \nTo review and approve/deny the use of the title, Doctor of Acupuncture.  \nTo develop and propose changes to existing rules and regulations to enhance the practice of acupuncture.  \n \n3. Given your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of an \nAcupuncture member, why do you believe that you are qualified for the \nposition? Please include a brief statement of your skills, expertise and \nknowledge that would aid you as a member of the Board.   \n My work and volunteer work will be an asset to the Board because they have \nprovided excellent experience that directly applies to this Board.  I have \nconducted executive searches for sensitive positions requiring the review of applicant\u2019s qualific ations and determining whether or not to refer the \napplicant for consideration by the hiring authority.  As an employee of the County of Orange and a Human Resources Consultant, an integral part of my \nwork involved the review of rules /regulations  and legis lation ; drafting \nproposed rules /regulations ; determining the impact of the changes ; and \ndeveloping procedures to implement the changes.  \n \n1 of 2   \n \n \n4. What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service ? \n \nI hope to become a valuable member of the Board by utilizing my past experience , knowledge, skill and abilities  to assist the Board in carrying out \nits mission and goals.  \n \n5. Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities will  \nbenefit the Acupuncture.  \n \nMy analytical ability will be beneficial in conducting the major work of the \nBoard.  \nMy dependability will ensure that I will participate in all meetings and fulfill \nmy commitment for the term of my appointment.  \nMy ability to work in a team to accomplish desired goals.   \n \n6. Name a previous experience you\u2019ve had that will be beneficial as an \nAcupuncture member.  \n \nI have served as a Board member for the YWCA, Christmas in April  (now \nRebuilding Together ) and for my Homeowner\u2019s Associations.    \n \n7. Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise during \nyour service on the Acupuncture? How would you overcome conflicts of \ninterest?  \n \nNo, I do not foresee any conflicts of interest. If a conflict arises, I would \nfollow appropriate regulations and if necessary, I would remove m yself from \nthe situation.  \n  \n \n     2 of 2   \n \nSTATE OF HAWAII  \nOFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR  \nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS  \n335 MERCHANT STREET, ROOM 310  \nP.O.

Serving on \nthe Board of Massage Therapy is my way of helping the community by guiding the industry that impacts so many local \nand non -residents. It is an area I have personally sought services from that my health care experience would be of \nbenefit for.  \n(2)        What do you perceive are the roles and respo nsibilities of a member of the Massage Therapy?  \nI perceive the core responsibility of the public board member as being a critical decision -maker acting on behalf of what \nis best for the community.

Please include a brief statement of your skills, expertise and knowledge that \nwould aid you as a member of the Board.  \nI have over 10 years of experience in the health care industry spanning multiple different areas, most recently in a \nhospital facility working in operations. In health care, the overarchi ng principle is to make decisions that are in the best \ninterest of the patient and to act in the best interest of the community would be no different.

I am often one of the last to speak after listening to all points of view.  \n(6)        Name a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a Massage Therapy member.  \nBoard members make decisions that are in the best interest of  the community.

My career has progressed from direct patient care, to teaching at our community college, \nconducting research, and now I would like to commit my time to a much larger purpose. I am interested \nto learn more about the political process and collaborate with the board to make important decisions.  \n  \n(2)  What do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of the Board of Physical \nTherapy?  \n  \nI believe the roles and responsibilities of the board include discussion and decision making to advise \nphysical therapy practice within the guidelines of the law. The board maintains a professional standard, promotes continuing education, approves education c ourses for licensure renewal, reviews applications \nfor licensure and assesses the need for disciplinary action.  \n  \n(3)  Given your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a Board of Physical Therapy member, \nwhy do you believe that you are qualif ied for the position?   Please include a brief statement of your \nskills, expertise and knowledge that would aid you as a member of the Board.  \n  \nIn the past 10 years, I have worked in several physical therapy settings including inpatient, \noutpatient, inpatie nt rehabilitation, and school -based therapy. More recently, I obtained my \nPediatric Specialty in Physical Therapy and became a principal investigator for the Hawaii Pacific Health Summer Student Research Program. \n \n  \nI will be able to provide the perspectiv e of a dedicated, Hawaii physical therapist. The skills I \nhave developed go beyond how to provide optimal patient care. I have learned to be a part of a multidisciplinary team. Years of collaboration has allowed me to develop better communication, objectiv ity, professionalism, confidence to provide my input, confidence to \nspeak up for patient advocacy, develop more efficient systems, and maintain integrity within our team of providers.\n \n  \n(4)  What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service?  \n  \nI would hope to ensure that the continuing education courses offered for credit toward licensure are \nreviewed and of good quality. I am passionate about continuing education and best practice as it \nelevates the physical therapy profession, as well as protects  and best serves our community.  \n  \n(5)  Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities will benefit the Board of \nPhysical Therapy.  \n  \nI see myself as a collaborator. Active listening, calm communication, and the ability to compromise will \nallow for productive meetings with the board.  \n  Confidence is key to be an active voice in the process. My confidence to speak up, even when not the \nmost convenient, comes from my nature as a \u201crule follower\u201d.  \n  \nI am also very enthusiastic and motivated as a PT. I care a lot about how I can improve someone\u2019s \nquality of life and I have greatly enjoyed my career as a physical therapist and educator. I am eager to apply the same energy and enthusiasm to serving on the board.  \n  \n(6) Name a previous e xperience you've had that will be beneficial as a Board of Physical Therapy \nmember.  \n  \nBecoming an adjunct professor for a physical therapy assistant program, was a new role for me about four years ago. I developed a course I felt was evidence based, applic able in the clinic and emphasized \nfamily centered care. I strengthened my public speaking skills, advanced my knowledge of pediatric \nphysical therapy, developed course content, and adapted to the challenges of teaching during COVID -19 \nrestrictions. As a part of the course curriculum, we discuss the legislation that financially supports and \nprovides guidelines to provide services for the members of our community. The knowledge, communication, organization, reliability, and adaptability developed during this time will now be applied \nto my new role as a member of the board.      \n(7)   Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise during your service on the Board \nof Physical Therapy?   How would you overcome conflicts of interest?  \n  \nConflict s of interest could arise due to the small community of physical therapists here in Hawaii. I also \nwork for two large health systems at Kapiolani Medical Center (Hawaii Pacific Health) and Queens \nMedical Center. The responsibility of a board member is to m aintain focus on the facts and the law to \nremain objective and unbiased. Self -awareness and full disclosure will be essential to be honest with \nmyself and others regarding my involvement and decision making with these matters.  \n \n Testimony of the Board of Physical Therapy  \n \nBefore the  \nSenate  Committee  on Commerce & Consumer Protection  \nFriday, February 18,  2022 \n9:30 a.m. \nVia Videoconference  \n \nOn the following measure:  \nG.M. 505, SUBMITTING FOR CONSIDERATION AND CONFIRMATION  \nTO THE BOARD OF PHYSICAL THERAPY ,  \nGUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE, STACIE KELIINOI ,  \nFOR A TERM TO EXPIRE 06-30-2025  \n \nChair Baker  and Members of the Committee:  \n My name is Rochelle Araki , and I am the Executive Officer  of the Board of \nPhysical Therapy  (Board).

I have found that serving on the Board of Psychology this past \nyear to be personally rewarding and educational, and hopefully of value to the \nDCCA and those we s erve.   \n  \n(2)        What do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of the \nBoard of Psychology?  \n \nAt a minimum, the roles and responsibilities of a member of the DCCA -BOP is to help \ninsure adherence to the State of Hawaii Rules and Statu es for the Practice of \nPsychology in order to insure the safety of the community by attending meetings, \npreparing for meetings by reviewing applications, offering opinions to the Board \nduring discussions as well as to the Board's Executive Director between \nmeetings, and to aid in reviewing and formulating an opinion on legislative issues \nthat affect the practice of psychology's impact on the health and safety of the \ncommunity.   \n  \n(3)        Given your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a Board of \nPsychology member, why do you believe that you are qualified for the \nposition?  Please include a brief statement of your skills, expertise and \nknowledge that would aid you as a member of the Board.  \n \nI believe that I am qualified to serve on the HI DC CA BOP since I have a range of \nexperience in psychology, having served as faculty of Departments of Psychiatry \nand Psychology at several Universities (Including the University of Hawaii), \nworked in prison and other forensic settings, worked in Federal serv ice (DOD \nand VA), and have been in private practice. I have been a licensed psychologist \nsince 1994, licensed in the State of Hawaii since 2012, served as President of \nthe Hawaii Psychological Association in 2017, where I continue to help \ncoordinate monthl y grand rounds and a separate monthly clinical case \nconference. In addition, I have served on the HI DCCA BOP since June of 2021 \nand look forward to continued service on the Board.   \n  \n(4)        What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service?  \n \nIn addition to the duties and responsibilities inherent in the position of a Board of \nPsychology member, I hope to help review and update the Rules for the Practice \nof Psychology, which were last modified more than 25 years ago - rendering \nmuch of the rules out of step with the current practice of psychology as it is \nrecommended by the American Psychological Association and most State Board \nof Psychology throughout the US and Canada.    I also plan to serve on the \nLegislative Committee of the BOP in order to review and help draft opinions \nregarding legislation related to the Practice of Psychology.    \n(5)        Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities will \nbenefit the Board of Psychology.  \n \nCommitted, Experienced, Collaborative  \n  \n(6)        Name a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a Board \nof Psychology member.  \n \nI have served as a member or President of several psychological organizations, \nincluding the HI DCCA Board of Psychology.  \n  \n(7)        Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise during \nyour service on the Board of Psychology?   How would you overcome \nconflicts of interest?  \n \nI have recused myself from the legislative committee of the Hawaii Psychological \nAssociation and have refrained from offering opinions on legislative matters that \nmay require an opinion from the BOP.   Nor will I e ngage in lobbying efforts on \nbehalf of any psychological association or organization that may require a BOP \nopinion.   I know of no other formal conflict of interest, and will do my best to not \nlet my decision on teh BOP be influenced by my being a licensed psychologist \nthat may or may not personally benefit from the Board's decision.  \n Testimony of the Board of Psychology  \n \nBefore the  \nSenate  Committee  on Commerc e & Consumer Protection  \nFriday, February 18, 2022  \n9:30 a.m.  \nVia Videoconference  \n \nOn the following measure:  \nG.M. 506, SUBMITTING FOR CONSIDERATION AND CONFIRMATION  \nTO THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY ,  \nGUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE, JAMES SPIRA ,  \nFOR A TERM TO EXPIRE 06-30-2026  \n \nChair Baker  and Members of the Committee:  \n My name is Christopher Fernandez , and I am the Executive Officer  of the Board of \nPsychology  (Board).

{"filename": "GM507_TESTIMONY_CPN_02-18-22_.PDF", "PDF": "GM507:  \nQuestionnaire for Nomination to the Board of Psychology \nJune W. J. Ching, Ph.D., ABPP  \n \n(1) Why do you wish to be a member of the Psychology Board?  \n \nI love psychology and being a psychologist. The field of psychology has \nprovided me with the opportunity to utilize my training, knowledge, \nexperience,  and skills to make a difference in meaningful ways for those \nin need of mental health services and to educate Hawaii\u2019s  community  \nabout access to behavioral health resources . It would be an honor and \nprivilege for me to serve on the Board of Psychology as a means of \ngiving back to Hawaii\u2019s community where I have dedicated over 40 years \nas a licensed practicing psychologist.   \n  \n(2) What do you perceive are the roles and responsibil ities of a member \nof the Psychology  Board ? \n \nAs a member of the Board of Psychology, I would be deeply committed to \nupholding licensing policies and maintaining standards of excellence in \npsychology practice that provide public health, safety , and welfare , while \npromoting the best practice by those l icensed to practice within our state.   \n \nThe role of the Board is also the regulate and protect the public from the \npractice of psychology by unqualified persons and from unprofessional \nconduct by persons licensed to practice psychology.  \n \n(3) Given your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a \nPsychology Board member, why do you believe that you are \nqualified for the position?  Please include a brief statement of your \nskills, expertise and knowledge that would aid you as a member of  \nthe Board.  \n \nEducationally, I earned my B.A. with honors from the University of Hawaii \nin 1973 and pursued graduate studies with a M.Ed. from Harvard \nUniversity in 1974 and a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from Northwestern \nUniversity in 1980. Upon receiving my doctorate, I became a licensed \npsychologist in Illinois, where I worked for a few years at the University of \nIllinois, Chicago Campus Counseling Center in addition to establishing a \npart-time independent practice.  \n \nIn 1981, I returned to my home state of Hawaii and have pursued my \nlifelong passion in utilizing psychology to promote, advance and deliver \nculturally informed mental health services to our communities. I am a \nHawaii licensed psychologist , having earned Board Certification from the \nAmerican Board of Professional Psychology in Clinical Psychology. My \nclinical and professional practice has specialized in the diagnostic \nassessment and treatment of a culturally diverse population of children, \nadolescents, adults, couples , and families. I have expertise in the \ntreatment of children, parents , and families  undergoing the divorce \nprocess and in the forensic investigative interview of minors with allegations of sexual abuse, felony physical abuse, and witness to \ninterpersonal violence. My other  areas of focus have included the \ndiagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and \nlearning disabilities, trauma, anxiety, depression, parenting, relationship \ndifficulties, and coping with major life stresses . \n \nAs a member of the Board, I plan to utilize additional knowledge and \nskills that I developed through experiences as a psychological consultant \nto judiciary  programs, multi -disciplinary teams and non- profits; Chief \nPsychologist and training director of an accredited psychology pre-\ndoctoral internship program; APA accreditation site visitor; university \nfaculty/lecturer; public education coordinator; expert wit ness in civil and \nfederal courts; guardian ad litem; child abuse forensic investigative \ninterviewer and statewide trainer; editorial board member and peer \njournal reviewer; supervisor and mentor; program developer; and national \nconference presenter.  \n \n(4) What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service?  \n \nOur psychology licensing laws serve to protect the public  by enforcing \nstandards that restrict practice to qualified individuals who have met \nqualifications in receiving a doctoral degree in psychology from an \naccredited institution of higher education , accrued the necessary formal \nsupervised training hours, and pass the Examination for Professional \nPractice in Psychology . I plan to contribute my time and expertise to \nensure that prospective applicants for licensure are qualified to practice \npsychology  based on Hawaii\u2019s  licensing laws  and regulations. I am also \ninvested in ensuring that licensed psychologists actively practicing w ithin \nour state pursue the requisite approved continuing education to keep \nabreast of the field in our diverse and multicultural communities.  \n \n(5) Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities \nwill benefit the Psychology.  \n \nA psychology colleague who served previous two terms on the Board of \nPsychology and worked closely with me over the years shared her \nimpressions of my qualities and how they will benefit Psychology \u201c Dr. \nChing has served in many leadership roles, both local ly and nationally \nand is an excellent role model for early career psychologists \u2026I strongly \nbelieve that Dr. Ching\u2019s integrity and professionalism will be an asset in \nfurthering the Board\u2019s mission.  She has consistently committed to \nexcellence in training psychologists, worked tirelessly to educate the \ncommunity about the scope of psychological practice, devoted time and \neffort to HPA and APA guild activities and maintained the highest ethical \nand professional standards in her work.\u201d  \n \nDedication and unwaveri ng commitment to psychology and \npsychologists.  \nThis is  exemplified by ongoing professional engagement in the delivery of \nculturally competent clinical services to patients, investment in the \neducation, training, and consultation for psychologists at various stages of their career s, advocating for scope of practice and access to services \nfor underserved populations, championing diversity and inclusion in all \nmy activities, coordinating psychoeducational public education activities,  \nand leadership service in state and national association matters.  \n \nProfessionalism.  \nMy pursuit of a high level of competence, knowledge and skills a s a \npracticing psychologist has kept me abreast of the most relevant issues \nfor professional psychology and standards of practice for licensing \nBoards  locally and nationally . I will enter the Board with a keen \nunderstanding of current considerations for practicing psychologists, \nstandards of care, licensing requirements, and interjurisdictional matters. \nOn the forefront of licensing boards are emerging issues of e quity, \ndiversity , and inclusion concerns , PSYPACT, ASPPB\u2019s efforts to \nimplement the EPPP -2 exam  for assessment of clinical competence , \nalong with healthcare access through telehealth.  \n \nWell Respected.  \nI have received feedback that I am well respected by my peers and those \nin the community. I strive to lead by example, be of service to others, and \nmodel integrity and highest ethical and professional standards in all my \nundertakings . My collaborative approach, conscientiousness, willingness \nto \u201cstep up to the plate\u201d, inclusiveness of others , and appreciation of \ndifferences are qualities that have been welcomed by committees, task \nforces, and boards that I have had the honor to serve on.  \n \n(6) Name a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a \nPsychology Board member.  \n \nMy sense of commitment has also extended to state and national guild \nactivities involving volunteer leadership positions in the Hawaii \nPsychological Association (HPA) and the American Psychological \nAssociation (APA). I have served as president of HPA and APA\u2019s Division \n42 (Psychologists in Independent Practice), along with serving on the \nNational Register Board for Health Care Psychologists, and APA Boards \nsuch as the Committee for the Advancement of Professional Practice, \nBoard of Professional Affairs, Board for the Advancement of Psychology \nin the Public Interest, Membership Board, and the APA Council of \nRepresentatives. Having served on HPA and APA advocacy committees, \nI am knowledgeable about legislative advocacy efforts that advance \npsychology practice. My other public service activities involve being a \nmember of the Diocesan Review Board and past advisory board member \nfor Prevent Child Abuse Hawaii.  \n \n(7) Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise \nduring your service on the Psychology?   How would you overcome \nconflicts of interest?  \n \nI am not aware of any existing conflicts of interest in my service on the \nPsychology Board. If any possible conflicts of interest arise, I plan to seek immediate consultation with the Board staff and AG for their input and \nguidance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n STATE OF HAWAII  \nOFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR  \nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS  \n335 MERCHANT STREET, ROOM 310  \nP.O.

{"filename": "GM508_TESTIMONY_CPN_02-18-22_.PDF", "PDF": "GM508: Nathaniel Lam  \n \n(1)    Why do you wish to be a member of the Hawaii Board of Veterinary Medicine?  \nI feel a sense of duty to servce on the Hawaii Board of Veterinary Medicine in order to contribute \nto the already excellent efforts in maintaining a high standard of safe/effective practices, \naccountability for its members, and further development of private and public programs that \nimprove the relationship between veterinarians, the State of Hawaii, and the community we \nhumbly serve.  \n \n(2)    What do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of the Hawaii Board of \nVeterinary Medicine?  \n A board member is responsible for upholding the standard of practice for veterinarians in the \nState of Hawaii according to the revised statutes currently in place, in accordance to the office \nof the Governor. Along with the other members of the board, and the DCCA, we are responsible \nfor pr oviding unbiased leadership in determing the best course of action when situations arise \nwhich require the review or revision of these statues. A board member is responsible for \nattending meetings, being aware of the issues that may require the board's att ention, \nmaintaining professional conduct when interacting with members of the community regarding \nissues that may discussed by the board, and advocating for the greater good of our professional \ncommunity and consumers.   \n  \n(3)    Given your understanding of  the roles and responsibilities of a Hawaii Board of Veterinary \nMedicine member, why do you believe that you are qualified for the position?   Please include a brief \nstatement of your skills, expertise and knowledge that would aid you as a member of the Boa rd. \n \nRecently, I had the honor of being appointed to serve as an interim member on the Board of \nVeterinary Medicine, which expires in June, 2022. I would like to express my interest to continue \nserving as a board member. I have been involved in organized v eterinary medicine since 2005, \nas a leader and president of our graduating class at Michigan State University, a representative for private and public organizations, and a member of the Michigan State Animal Response \nTeam. Following my residency training i n surgery, I became a Diplomate of the American \nCollege of Veterinary Surgeons and moved to Honolulu where I also spent much of my youth. I \nsaw a great need in Hawaii for veterinary specialists and could not help but feel compelled to \nreturn to be a part of the solution in caring for the islands' animals and their owners.   \n  \nFor the last 9 years I have been practicing at VCA Oahu Veterinary Specialty Center as the sole \nsurgeon, performing specialty services ranging from routine orthopedic operations and cancer \nsurgery to interventional radiology techniques, emergency surgery, and counseling clients for \nthrough end- of life management. Through these experiences my heart continues to grow for the \npatients and people in our community. Outside the operating room,  I have dedicated my life to \nimproving the lives and welfare of animals and humans through serving as a consultant and \nveterinary surgeon for state/federal departments, engaging in veterinary conservation work, and \nmost recently also serving on the board o f the Hawaii Humane Society and an advisory board \nmember of North Shore Stables, an equine retirement center and therapeutic riding non -profit in \nOahu. In 2022 I will be co- founding Hawaii's first long- term sea turtle rehabilitation therapy \ncenter. These diverse positions have given me both breadth and depth of experience regarding \nthe interaction between veterinarians and the private/public sector in an objective way.  \n  \n  \n(4)    What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service?   \nMy goals, as a potential ongoing interim member of the Board of Veterinary Medicine, are three-\nfold.  \n  \n1. Expanding the Depth and Breadth of Animal / Veterinarian Care  \nCurrently our islands are in a state of crisis due to the availability of licensed veterinarians, veterinary specialists, and support staff. Accessibility of care is constantly threated by the cost of treatment, and the availability of treatment in a timely fashion. Burnout in our profession is at \nan all -time high according to 2021 AVMA Surveys. My primary  goal is to improve the ability of \nour State to recruit qualified permanent and relief veterinary staff to meet the needs of our community, while maintaining a high standard of practice and adequate oversight. Specifically, \nthe number and type of veterinar y specialists, emergency veterinarians, licensed veterinary \ntechnicians, mixed and large/food animal practitioners must increase. My secondary goal is to \nwork with political, industry, and community leaders to establish a self -sustaining means for all \nanim als to be able to receive needed humane medical attention and care. No animal or family \nshould be left behind, and no veterinarian should be overwhelmed to the point of wanting to the \nleave profession, or suicide.   \n  \n2. Being Prepared  \nAt this time , Hawaii is one of the few remaining states that does not have a state emergency \naction plan or team with regards to its animals. Animals are an extremely important part of our \nculture and community, from the Honolulu Zoo, Sealife Park and Aquarium, to far ms, ranches, \nresearch and quarantine facilities, animal shelters, domestically owned animals, and wild \nanimals both native and invasive. Hawaii is at significant risk of catastrophic disasters due to its \nlocation, risks from natural and manmade disasters as well as zoonotic disease outbreaks. \nPreparedness for these emergencies MUST include a plan for Hawaii's animals, and this will have a direct impact on human survival as well. My goal is to work towards establishing a \nHawaii State Animal Response Team, as  a public -private partnership that works directly with the \nOffice of Emergency Management, the Hawaii Humane Society, and federal agencies to \nsupport the current protocols in place for our state.   \n  \n3. Doing What We Already Do, Better.  \nAs part of the Depar tment of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, one of the Board's missions is \nto maintain a high standard of practice and ethics within our profession. While the Board currently serves as mostly a \"reactive\" force to concerns amongst consumers and professionals, \nfuture focus dedicated to proactive changes and programs to prevent harm to our community is \nimportant. My goal is to work together with the Board and non- government organizations such \nas the HVMA to support both consumers and professionals by providing re sources and \nencourage mandatory education with a specific focus on responsible pet ownership, client -\ndoctor communication, mental health, and conflict resolution.    \n  \nI hope that through my participation on the Board, that we can work together to create legislative \ninitiatives and engage our professional and public communities together in improving animal \nwelfare, supporting veterinarians, and instilling confidence in our community.  \n \n(5)    Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities  will benefit the Hawaii \nBoard of Veterinary Medicine.  \n  I am fair, and non -judgemental, able to see all sides of an argument yet unwavering in my own \nboundaries and beliefs. I am well connected in the community and able to provide insight to \nmany facets o f our profession. Lastly, I am passionate about the advancement of our profession \nand our ability to serve the community and the State.   \n \n(6)    Name a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a Hawaii Board of Veterinary \nMedicine member.  \n  I have served on the board of several other organizations, although this is the first government \nappointed position I have sought. I understand the importance of protocol and running effective \nmeetings, and while I am new in learning the process of writi ng, and introducing legislation, I \ncan extrapolate from other experiences to help me become an effective board member.   \n \n(7)    Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise during your service on the \nHawaii Board of Veterinary Medici ne?  How would you overcome conflicts of interests?  \n                               \nI am currently employed by a corporate entity as a veterinarian in the state of Hawaii, and I am \nan active board member of the Hawaii Humane Society. While both of these groups may have \nan agenda or bias with regards to topics discussed by the board, I hav e been explicit in \nseparating my participation or involvement with these entities and the BVM.    \n \n \n \n Testimony of the Hawaii Board of Veterinary  Medicine  \n \nBefore the  \nSenate  Committee  on Commerce and Consumer Protection  \nFriday, February 18, 2022  \n9:30 a.m.  \nVia Videoconference  \n \nOn the following measure:  \nG.M. 508, SUBMITTING FOR CONSIDERATION AND CONFIRMATION  \nTO THE  HAWAII  BOARD OF VETERINARY MEDICINE , \nGUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE, NATHANIEL LAM ,  \nFOR A TERM TO EXPIRE JUNE 30, 202 3 \n \nChair Baker  and Members of the Committee:  \n My name is Kerrie Shahan , and I am the Executive Officer  of the Hawaii Board of \nVeterinary Medicine  (Board).

Chair Baker, Vice Chair Chang and Committee Members:  I am Henry Miyamura, Professor Emeritus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a retired Music Director of the Hawaii Youth Symphony orchestras.  I am testifying in favor of Gubernatorial Nominee, Mr. Leslie Murata\u2019s, consideration for and confirmation to the State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology, for a term to expire on June 30, 2025.  Mr. Murata has dedicated much of his life to community service, including work as a Band Booster for Waialua High School and as a volunteer for nearly 30 years with the Hawaii Youth Symphony. Mr. Murata served a great amount of time as vice president of the Hawaii Youth Symphony as well.  It was during his time with the Hawaii Youth Symphony that I became aware of Mr. Murata\u2019s total dedication to the Youth Symphony. For one thing, he volunteered much of his time to raise funds and make travel reservations for the students of the Youth Symphony to perform in Japan and in the continental United States. He also aided in the set-up of events and performances, arranging various heavy instruments at the Youth Symphony concerts. Such a job would require a dozen men, but Mr. Murata happily did it all on his own.  Although he is no longer associated with the Hawaii Youth Symphony, Mr. Murata is no less enthusiastic to volunteer. Mr. Murata has continually given his time freely without expecting any personal reward, and he does so to this day. He is always humble and grateful to be able to help and is well appreciated by me and all those who have worked with him.  I believe Mr. Murata to be an excellent candidate for this position because of his hard work and dedication throughout the years. Mr. Murata is a great man with humility and service in his heart. I know that he will bring such values \u2013 and more \u2013 to the Board. I know that when Mr. Murata is confirmed to the State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology, he will be a great and valuable asset in all that he does as a member of the Board.  I urge the committee to consider and confirm Mr. Murata to the State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology. Thank you for this opportunity to testify. Henry Miyamura Senator Rosalyn H.

I wish to  be considered for another term based on my knowledge and \nexperience in nursing in our state, the mainland, and internationally.  I have also served \non the board since 2017 when an emergency replacement needed to occur.  I have \nattended nearly all schedule d meetings and am consistently prepared for them.  I also \nserve on the Education Committee that meets bimonthly and contributed significantly to \nthat subcommittee.  \n \nWhat do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of the Board of \nNursing ? \nThe roles and responsibilities of the BON are three -fold and include legislative, \nadjudicatory, and executive functions.  I support the BON by carefully reviewing pending \nlegislation to provide a professional opinion to the membership and the EO.  I suppor t \nthe adjudicatory functions by reviewing RICO findings and recommendations while considering \u00a7457-5 and Subchapter 11 \u00a7 16-89-59 through 64.   The rules must be \ncarefully reviewed while maintaining nursing ethical and practice standards.  Supporting executi ve functions occur when reviewing licensure applications from in - and out- of- \nstate and internationally.  Knowledge of the nation organization the National Council of State B oard s of Nursing  (NCSBN) is important in all the functions.  \n \nGiven your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a Board of Nursing \nmember, why do you believe that you are qualified for the position?  Please include a \nbrief statement of your skills, expertise and knowledge that would aid you as a member of  the Board  \nI believe I am qualified to serve on the board for another term because of my education \nincluding a Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing from Creighton University, a Master\u2019s in Nursing from the University of the Philippines (in Manila) and a pos t-\nmaster\u2019s as a Family \nNurse Practitioner from the University of Hawai\u2018i School of Nursing at M\u0101noa now \nnamed the Nancy Atmospera -Walch School of Nursing.   I also have nearly 40 years of 2 bedside, supervisory and administrative, and educational experience a s a professional \nnurse.   I remain current in inpatient practice by serving as a clinical instructor to all level \nof nursing students in long -term and acute care settings on O\u2018ahu.  \n \nWhat do you hope to accomplish during your term of service ? \nIf granted  another term, I would like to become more familiar with the NCSBN on a \ngreater scale.  Many activities have been limited for nearly two years because of the \npandemic.  I would also like to interface with other state boards to determine if there was more our b oard could do to support the state and/or nurses.  I would like to fully \nsupport the board, Education Committee, and the EO by continuing to research agenda item topics .  \n \nName three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities will benefit the  \nBoard of Nursing?  \nThe qualities I bring to the position include preparation, perseverance, and commitment.   \nThese qualities equate to being prepared for all meetings, reviewing information that \narrives to us, and consistent attendance at monthly board meetings and bimonthly Education Committee meetings.  These are consistently performed in addition to my full -\ntime teaching position.    \nName a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a  Board of Nursing  \nmember  \nI am a more vocal nurse on th e board and ask carefully -crafted questions while offering a \nprofessional expertise.  The legal council and I consistently agree with enacting \nrecommendations while adhering to state laws.  She, however, has a much greater repertoire with the law and the practices and procedures to enact the board\u2019s recommendations.  \n \nCan you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise during your service \non the  Board of Nursing?  How would you overcome conflicts of interest?  \nI have no conflict of interest in property, business interests, and/or personnel within the \nDCCA and/or Board of Nursing.  \n Please do not hesitate to contact me should any additional information be needed.  \n Sincerely,  \n Karen R.

I also have the honor to make recommendations to Congress.  \nI want to bring my knowledge, perspective, exper tise, and resources while collaborating \nwith other nurse leaders and nurse experts in the State of Hawai'i. In doing so, I would like to contribute to maintaining our State's high standard of safe nursing care and \npromoting improvements and advancement of the nursing profession in Hawai'i.  \n(2) What do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of the State Board of \nNursing? \nI perceive that the roles and responsibilities of a member of the State Board of Nursing include:  \n\u2022 Regulates nurses' li censures  \n\u2022 Reviews nursing policies and set the standard for safe nursing care and practice,  \n\u2022 Abide by rules and recommendations from the American Nurses Association \n\u2022 Helps in deciding the scope of practice for nurses  \n\u2022 Review and issue licenses to qualified candidates  \n\u2022 Checks nursing programs to ensure they are maintaining current, rigorous nursing training and providing quality nursing education  \n\u2022 Collaborates with other professionals  \n\u2022 Oversees any disciplinary actions for nursing practice violations and participate in policy evaluations.  \n(3) Given your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a State Board of Nursing member, why do you believe that you are qualified for the position? Please include a brief \nstatement of your skills, expertise, and knowl edge that would aid you as a member of the Board.  \nI am confident that the community and the State of Hawai\u02bbi will benefit significantly from \nmy academic training, experiences as a nurse administrator and educator, and my thirty -\ntwo years of practice as a nurse. At present, I am a tenured Assistant Professor of \nNursing and the Nursing and Allied Health Division Administrator/Division Chair for the \nLPN, ASN, LPN to ASN pathway Hawai\u02bbi Community College (Hawai\u02bbi CC) Hilo and \nKona/P\u0101lamanui Nursing Programs and the Fire Science Hilo and Kona/P\u0101lamanui \nProgram.  As a nurse, faculty, and administrator, my objective is to promote a multifaceted and \nmeaningful nursing education based on the philosophy of student -centered learning \nguided by the theoretical beliefs of the Unitary Human Beings (UHB) Nursing Model. My \nrole as an assistant professor and nursing administrator extends beyond teaching. It \nincludes involvement and service in several divisional and college committees and \nprofessional and community organizations  at the local, state, national, and international \nlevels. I believe my participation in these groups enhances my abilities as a faculty \nmember, a leader, and a teacher, which broadens my own knowledge and helps me \nshare current innovations, current ideas, and information with colleagues, which helps \nimprove the nursing profession and practice.  \nAt Hawai\u02bbi CC, I served as chair on various division and college committees, including \nthe faculty senate and executive committees. I am experienced in curriculum \ndevelopment and improvement, educational policy, and research, and I continue to \ndevelop my leadership skills. I recently experienced the accreditation process with \nHawai\u02bbi CC, wherewith my assistance, its ASN program received full accreditation. In \n2019, I w as selected as the Hawai\u02bbi CC representative in the University of Hawai\u02bbi (UH) \nCommunity College Leadership Champion (UH CCLC) Program's current generation 16. As UH CCLC Champion, I take part in monthly leadership conferences conducted \namong the UH community colleges. Recently, I organized an educational conference for \nUH CCLC held at Hawai\u02bbi CC on civility and bullying in nursing education. I'm on the UH \nManoa's Evidence- Based Practice Committee (EBP Champions) and the UH \nPamantasan Council, a UH Filipino culture organization that promotes higher education \nin the community. I assisted with coordinating the Hawai\u02bbi CC recent Pamantasan \nconference, an event I hosted and emceed, and where I was presented with Dr. Ernesto \n\"Niki\" Libarios, Jr. Award of Excellen ce for an outstanding faculty or staff member of \nFilipino descent.  \nI'm a member of the National Advisory Council for Nursing Education and Practice \n(NACNEP), a federal government position helping advise the Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Congress on policy issues \nrelated to nursing education and practice. I contribute to the Academic Progression in \nNursing (APIN): Hawaii initiative, a foundation that collaborates and develops \ngroundbreaking strategies to meet the Institute of Medicine's recommendations. I served \nas the Hawai'i CC National League of Nursing Ambassador, was the community asthma \neducator for the American Lung Association's Open Airways and Asthma 101 courses, \ncreated a community health course with Hui  M\u0101lama Ola N\u0101 \u02bb\u014ciwi, and served as a \nDirector for the Ka'u Rural Health Community Association.  \n(4) What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service? \nWithin my years of service, I wish to make positive changes that can improve the \nsupport of nurs ing faculty. I would like to contribute to creating innovative strategies to \nimprove how we educate nursing students during challenges such as the COVID -19 \npandemic and ensure patients receive quality care from nurses.  \n(5) Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities will benefit the State \nBoard of Nursing.  \nI am an excellent collaborator, open- minded and detailed.   (6) Name a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a State Board of Nursing \nmember.  \nThe recent experience I had was joining forces with other nurse leaders in creating a \nmessage to campaign for Covid -19 vaccinations. The article \"Hawai\u02bbi Nurses Ask the \nPublic to Get Vaccinated, Get Boosters and Practice Cautious Gathering During the Upco ming Holiday Season\" was published last November 16, 2021.  \nMy previous involvement was creating the NACNEP 17th Report Preparing Nurse \nFaculty and Addressing the Shortage of Nurse Faculty and Clinical Preceptors to \nCongress in 2020.  \n(7) Can you foresee any  possible conflicts of interest that could arise during your service on the \nState Board of Nursing? How would you overcome conflicts of interest?  \nCurrently, I do not foresee any conflicts of interest.  \nTo avoid any conflict of interest, I would need to carefully read the rules, regulations, and \npolicies that I need to abide by while serving. If I see a conflict of interest, I will report \nand disclose conflicts of interest in an open and honest way.  \nShould a conflict of interest arise during my service on the State Board of Nursing, I \nwould communicate and seek advice from experts and, if necessary, remove or resign \nfrom the committee. I would do the appropriate and necessary actions to make things \nright and fix my mistake.    \n Mahalo for reading my answers!  \n  \n \nSTATE OF HAWAII  \nOFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR  \nDEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS  \n335 MERCHANT STREET, ROOM 310  \nP.O.

Luz Miguel\u2019s nomination to serve for the Hawai\u02bbi State Board of Nursing.  \n \nI am a Counselor at Hawai\u02bbi Community College and serve as Advisor to the Samahang Filipino Club on campus. In this \ncapacity, I have known Dr. Miguel for her consistent and  highly effective professional productive level, her exception al \nexpertise and commitment to keeping current  in the Nursing discipline, her outstandin g service the larger community, and \nstrong relationships w ith students and colleagues.  \n \nLast Spring 2021, I had the pleasure of participating in the college Advisory Council meetin g where Dr. Miguel presented on \nthe achievements of the Nursing programs which  included 100% graduation rates for both the AS Nursing and Practical \nNursing programs.  During periods  of both leadership transition within the HawCC Nursing and Alli ed Health Division and \nCOVID 19 public health crisis, Dr. Miguel stepped up to fill important leadership role s. In December 2020, Dr. Miguel was \nappointed the In terim Nursing Administrator after the departure of their former administrator. Without hesitation or d elay, \nDr. Miguel took on this responsibility to ensure minimal impact to students and the Nursing program s. Dr. Miguel has truly \ndemonstrated her exceptional leadership and service to her department, for stepping into the administrator role, while also \nmaintaining her previous duties as the Progra m Coordinator and Instructor for the division\u2014effectively taking on  more than  \ntwo full time positions. This is truly a testament to Dr. Miguel\u2019s highly effective productive level.  \n \nDr. Miguel has also demonstra ted a high commitment to staying current in the Nursing discipline. In 2020, she had the \ndistinction of serving as a Peer Reviewer for  a Research Manuscript, and also published an article in the Asian/Pacific Island \nNursing Journal  for the University of Haw ai\u02bbi. Dr. Miguel additionally stays active in the field through her membership in a \nhost of professional organizations, such as The National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice (NACNEP), \nNurses on Boards Coalition (NOBC), and the Eviden ce Base d Pratice (EBP) Hawai\u02bbi State Center for Nursing, to just name a \nfew. \n In addition to her service to the college and her professional field, Dr. Miguel is an active servant in the community. I have had the honor of working alongside Luz in several activiti es, such as the Student Exchange partnership with the University of \nNorthern Philippines (UNP), where she has collected critical Nursing supplies and teaching resources for UNP; as well as the \nSakada Day community celebration, which honors the contribution s of Hawai\u02bbi \u2019s Filipino plantations workers. In the Fall \n2019, Dr. Miguel was awarded Outstanding Filipina Faculty and Staff Award at the UH Pamantasan Conference, for her \nleadership to the college and Filipino community.  \n While Dr. Miguel\u2019s accomplishment s are impressive, one of the most exceptional qualities of Dr. Miguel is the positive \nenergy, warm spirit, and authentic care she expresses and extends to her students, colleagues, and all whom she works with. \nDuring these uprecedented times of ch allenge, crisis, and uncertaint y, Dr. Miguel ha s a provided a solid foundation;  and she \ndoes this with aloha.  \n \nI fully suppor t Dr. Miguel\u2019 s nomination to serve for  the Hawai\u02bbi State Board of N ursing. I t is a honor to provide this \ntestimony on her behalf. Thank you for your consideration.  \n Sincerely,  \n \nDr. Jeanne Batallones  \n \n \nJoan Thompson Pagan  \n200 West Kawili Street  \nHilo, Hawaii 96720  \nFebruary 15, 2022  \nDear Senator Baker,  \nThis letter serves to support Dr Luz Miguel \u2019s nomination for the Hawai \u2019i State Board of \nNursing.  \n \nIt is with great  pleasure that I  write this letter of recommendation for Dr. Luz Miguel .

Baker : \nI am submitting a written  testimony in support for the consideration and confirmation to the State \nBoard of Nursing, Gubernatorial Nominee, LUZVIMINDA MIGUEL, for a term to expire 06 -\n30-2026.  \n \nMy name is Dr. May Kealoha, former nursing faculty and Dept. Chair for Kapi\u02bbolani \nCommunity College (KCC) and Hawai\u02bbi Community College (HCC), now retired.  I have \nworked with  Dr. Miguel for more than 30 years in my role as a nursing instructor and \nChairperson when Dr. Miguel was a nurse at Kapi\u02bbolani Medical Center, nursing student at \nKCC, nursing faculty at HCC , and University of Hawai\u02bbi M\u0101noa Doctor of Nursing Practice  \n(DNP) gradua te student .  \n \nAs a member of the  State  Board of Nursing, Dr. Miguel will bring substantial  and significant \nperspectives and experiences to the Board in its oversight of nurses statewide. R ationale s for my \nstrong support of Dr. Miguel  are as follows :  \n \n1) Dr. Miguel has i n-depth professional nursing experiences in a variety of health care \nsettings including acute care, long -term care, outpatient care, and rural health in the \npositions as licensed practical nurse (LPN), registered nurse, a nd nurse educator  teaching \nin diverse clinical settings and levels of nursing education.  \n2) Dr. Miguel is demonstrating effective  leadership as the current Nursing \nAdministrator/Division Chair Nursing and Fire Science Programs  at HCC . Additionally, \nher volunteer leadership involvement are notable such as  the National Advisory Council \non Nurse Education and Practice , statewide  Evidence Based Practice Hawai \u02bbi State \nCenter for Nursing , and community -based  Philippine Nurses Association Hawa i\u02bbi.  \n3) I can a ttest to her  character traits of reliability, honesty, hard work, diligence, \nimpartiality, conscientiousness, and genuine care for clients, students, and the \ncommunity. I personnally admire her aptitude to listen and consider various perspectives \nbefore making a thoughtful and just decisi on. Respectful t eamwork is her core value.  2 \n \n4) Having more than 15 years of professional experience living in Hilo, Hawai\u02bbi , Dr. Mig uel \nwill convey the unique perspectives and needs of neighbor island nurses and communities  \nto the State Board of Nursing . \n \nOne personal account of Dr. Miguel \u2019s concern  and commitment  to rural residents is her DNP \nproject conducted in 2016. She brought  much needed asthma education  to the residents of Ka\u02bb\u016b , \nHawai, an area of high volcanic pollution exposure , over a number of weeks  via in-person group  \nand in -home sessions . Moreover , Dr. Miguel published the specific interventions and positive \noutcomes  of the project  in the  Asian/Pacific Island Nursing Journal  in 2020 to the international \nnursing community  thereby sharing how a rural program can be successfully implemented.  \n \nI am confident that Dr. Miguel will be a dedicated  member of the State Board of Nursing and \nwork diligently to carry out its responsibilities. She will adhere to the high standards of nursing, \nnursing education, and nursing practice as she has so consistently demonstrated in my \nassociation with her over the years.  \n \nThank you for allowing me to  submit a written  testimony in  strong  support for the consideration \nand confirmation to the State Board of Nursing, Gubernatorial Nominee, LUZVIMINDA \nMIGUEL, for a term to expire 06 -30-2026.  \n \nRespecfully submitted,  \n \nMay Kealoha  (electronic signature)  \n \nMay Kealoha, PhD, MPH, MSN, RN  \nProfessor (retired)  \nKapi\u02bbolani Community College  \nDept . of Nursing  \n  \nMy name is Kathleen Kotecki,  R.N., MSN  Associate Profes sor \u2013 Hawai\u2019i Communi ty College (retired 2021 )  \nMy friendship with Dr. Luz viminda Miguel  has grown over the years. I thoroughly enjoyed my time \nworking with Dr. Miguel  and found her be a very thoughtful and dependable person.  \nWithout a doubt, Dr. Miguel  is a dedicated and knowledge Nursing Professor with high standards for \nherself and her students. While being one of the easiest person to work with, she is still able to maintain \na professional demeanor with her colleagues and her  students. She is  always up to a challenge  and \ncompletes it beyond expectations.  Dr. Miguel  is the type of person that uniquely stands out above all \nthe rest.   \n \n \n \n 17 February 2022  \n \nRE: In support of Luzviminda Miguel\u2019s nomination to Hawai'i State Board of Nursing  \n \nSenator Baker,  \n  I am writing this letter in support of Luzviminda Miguel\u2019s nomination to the Hawai'i  \nState Board of Nursing.  I have known Ms. Miguel since she started teaching at Hawai'i \nCommunity College\u2019s (HawCC) School of Nursing in 2013.  I was the Nursing Learning \nResource Coordinator (NLRC) and also assisted the faculty with high fidelity patient \nsimulations.  At that time Ms. Miguel was hired to teach the Practical Nursing (PN) Students.  \n \n One of the highlights working with Ms. Miguel is when she organized a colla boration \nwith the UH School of Pharmacy to do a patient simulation involving her PN students and \npharmacy students.  It was a great learning experience for all the students and the faculty as \nwell.  In pioneering this collaboration, the door was opened for  HawCC\u2019s Associate of Science \nNursing students to do collaborate with the UH Hilo Nursing students and the UH Pharmacy \nstudents in the following years.  \n \n In the ensuing years Ms. Miguel also taught the Associate of Science of Nursing 2nd \nyear students, be came nursing program coordinator, and currently is the Director of the \nNursing program, She became involved in many college committees, participated in \nnumerous community activities, and is serving on state wide and national nursing committees. \nShe is very  student -centered, a good listener, and always ready to give a hug if needed.  \n \n There were a number of nursing faculty who quit or retired throughout the Covid \npandemic. Ms. Miguel stepped up at this crucial time (Spring 2020) to become the director of \nnursing.  As the nursing department lost these faculty, their positions were not filled. My NLRC \nposition was one of these positions that was cut and still is vacant.  Ms. Miguel realizes how \nimportant good nursing faculty are to the success of the students a nd a nursing program and \nhas continually fought to open these crucial faculty positions.  \n \n In conclusion, Ms. Miguel will make an outstanding member of the Board of Nursing \nand I strongly support her appointment.  \n \nRespectfully Submitted,  \n \n \n   \n \nErick Crem er, RN, MSN, MPH (retired HawCC nursing faculty)  \n \n  \n"},

I have known him since he began his \naccounting career. I have both mentored and educated him in the field of accounting.  I have \nsupervised his work and accounting career.  He has always been an extraordinary academic and possesses  the characteristics needed in the indust ry today.  \n  I strongly support his nomination for the Hawaii State Board of Public Accountancy.   \n \nThank you for allowing me to provide testimony in support of the confirmation of \nZachary Johnson.  \n   \n  \nG.M. 516-Submitting for consideration and confirmation to the State Board of Public \nAccountancy, Gubernatorial Nominee, ZACHARY JOHNSON, for a term to expire 06 -30-2025.  \nGood morning , Chair Baker, Vice -Chair Chang  and Members of the Committee on Commerce \nand Consumer Protection:  \nMy name is Terrence Aratani and I am submitting testimony as a private individual and not as a \nmember on the Board of Public Accountancy  (Board) .  I strongly support  the confirmation \nZachar y Johnson to the Board for the foregoing reasons.  \nI am the Chief Executive Officer of Ko`olauloa Health Center on the North Shore of O`ahu.  I \nhave been the CEO for the last 7 years .  Mr. Johnson joined our health center while a student at \nBYU-Hawaii.  At that time, he was pursuing a degree in accounting and  worked for us on a part -\ntime basis as an accounting clerk  under the direction of our controller, who was a CPA .  His \nwork was outstanding and the controller wanted him to work on a full-time basis.  He was \nemployed for 2 years with us up until his graduation.   After graduation, he left Hawaii to b e \nwith his parents in Nevada.  \nMr. Johnson received his CPA license  in the state of Nevada in 20 20.  He then worked nearly  \ntwo years in public accountancy in Las Vegas.  I have been looking for a CFO for the past several \nyears , but due to our rural location I could not find someone with sufficient skills and \nknowledge to  provide our health center with solid accounting.  It was even suggested by our \nfederal regulators that we acquire the services of large mainland firms to do our financial work.   \nLast year, Mr. Johnson realized how much he missed Hawaii and his favorite a ctivities, surfing, \nfishing , and diving.  He approached me about being our CFO and I am proud to say that we \nfinally have a qualified permanent CFO.  Since his return in a leadership position, Mr. Johnson \nhas enhanced our accounting system to provide us wi th more accurate measures  and \npredictions  for our costs and revenues.   \nIn 2021, we had a new member join the Board  of Public Accountancy .  Soon after becoming a \nmember, he moved out of state and no longer met the qualifications to serve .  I saw this as an \nopportunity for a young CPA to learn about our state government and provide a new \nperspective to the Board.  I asked Mr. Johnson if he would be interested and he applied.  If he is \nconfirmed, we will serve different roles on the Board a s I am the public member,  and he would \nbe a CPA member.  I do not see any potential conflict and I can assure you our decisions will be \nindependent.  My term ends on  June 30, 2023.  I hope to mentor Mr. Johnson during my last \nyear  on serving the public , just as I mentored many  others while serving as staff at the \nLegislature.  \nThank you for this opportunity to testify in support of Mr. Johnson.

Mr. Smith has been a long-time partner with Hawaii Habitat for Humanity Association, as our Certified Public Accountant, who annually audits our financials.  Our organization has changed substantially over the last few years, since we became a certified CDFI and increased our lending capacity to nonprofit low-income homeownership developers and builders.  Investments and reporting required a pivotable change in some of the ways we account for funds on our annual report.  Mr. Smith has been instrumental in consulting with us in these matters and has continued to be an integral part of our team.  With his knowledge in nonprofit accounting and understanding the activities of CDFIs, I believe he will be a valued member on the State Board of Public Accountancy.

I have had the pleasure of working with Mr. Oho for 27 years; both in the classroom as well as on the road as a paramedic.  With this, I feel highly qualified in providing this letter of support.  There are several qualities, in particular, I greatly admire.  Mr. Oho is a highly qualified and regarded Professor.  His students consistently score in the very top tier with regard to national certification exams.  As the department chair, I also have had opportunities in reviewing his student and peer evaluations.   He is highly regarded by both so much so he has been a finalist for faculty member of the year.  He also sets patient care standards with his patient-centered high-quality approach when working as a Paramedic.  These qualities, among many others, are why Mr. Oho would be a positive and productive member of EMSAC.   He has the experience, knowledge, capacity, and passion that is required to provide the Department of Health with guidance on how our EMS system functions.    In conclusion, I strongly support the appointment of  Mr. Oho as a member of EMSAC.  He is and will continue to be an amazing and contributary public servant.

He will bring \nnothing but support, knowledge, passion and dedication to this committee.   \n Greetings,  My name is Edward Caballero and I am submitting testimony on my behalf as a private citizen, in support of GM 524 (Submitting for consideration and confirmation to the Emergency Medical Services Advisory Committee, Gubernatorial Nominee, STACEY OHO, for a term to expire 06-30-2024). I have known Mr. Stacey Oho for the last twelve (12) years as a colleague at Kapi\u2019olani Community College, where we work as Emergency Medical Service (EMS) educators. Stacey has proven himself, year after year, as an advocate for EMS students, programs, and systems across the state.  His reputation as a stalworth and effective educator is proven by the number of paramedics graduated, over the last decade. It is his dedication to the profession that makes him an exceptional candidate for the position of an Emergency Medical Service Advisory Committee (EMSAC) member.   Stacey not only advocates for his students but also for all the patients he encounters while working as a paramedic. His continued clinical experience is translated into \u201creal-life\u201d scenarios that current students can learn from.  He also is a major \u201cvoice\u201d in our community regarding the most up-to-date standards from the American Heart Association (AHA), ensuring that all EMS instructors are updated accordingly.  Stacey is also a very level-headed individual who makes decisions that are for the greater good of the EMS system as a whole. His role as an educator, paramedic, and quality assurance supervisor continues to prove his dedication to the field and the future of EMS.   Therefore, it is through this testimony that I am in support of GM 524 (Submitting for consideration and confirmation to the Emergency Medical Services Advisory Committee, Gubernatorial Nominee, STACEY OHO, for a term to expire 06-30-2024).

My name is Tina Hamayasu and I am testifying in support of the confirmation of Mr. Stacey Oho to the Emergency Medical Services Advisory Committee (EMSAC).  Mr. Oho was my paramedic instructor and was influential in the start of my career as a Mobile Intensive Care Technician (MICT). I had the honor of becoming his colleague teaching the most recent MICT class at Kapiolani Community College (KCC) Department of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and his colleague working for American Medical Response (AMR) on the island of Kauai.  I have watched and learned from Mr. Oho of what it takes to provide high quality care for our patients, and to give back to our communities. Mr. Oho has been serving the community of Kauai as a paramedic for the past 33 years. He understands the communities and available resources on the island of Kauai and would be instrumental in bringing positive changes to Kauai EMS.   I believe the State of Hawaii is fortunate to have Mr. Stacey Oho as a member of the EMSAC. I know he will continue to bring his knowledge, expertise, and experience to the committee and help the State of Hawaii EMS exceed national standards, and thus provide the people of Kauai, and Hawaii, with highly trained Emergency Medical Technicians and superior Emergency Medical Services.

I have a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Nutrition and Food Management from Oregon State University that comes with the knowledge and know how to make a di\ufb00erence in people\u2019s health, and this is the reason I thought the Health Planning Council could be a good \ufb01t for me.  I worked for Marriott right out of college for several years, creating menus, managing school foodservice, counseling students and sta\ufb00 and teaching nutrition workshops.  I was recruited by Starbucks in 1996, to help them open stores and train sta\ufb00 in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area of Arizona.  These two positions gave me invaluable experience being part of larger companies and managing many people and di\ufb00erent moving parts.\nI have had my own company and most recently, I am working as a realtor with Coldwell Banker Island Properties.  I am continually thinking about how I can help others and my community and volunteering for the Hawaii State Boards and Commissions seems like an obvious next step.  I like to donate my time and money when I can, and I am hoping by being part of a board, I can help share di\ufb00erent ideas and experiences that may be able to help enhance our beautiful island community!\nThank you for your time and consideration!

I know Donna both as a friend, and as a business associate. Donna has always been reliable and of great integrity in our interac7ons.

I have  \nattempted  to submit  testimony  for the hearing  scheduled  for Friday,  February  18, 2022,  at 1:00  pm/ \nHearing_HTH_02 -18-22. Unfortunately,  I have not been  successful  in navigating  the process  \nof submitting  testimony; hence,  I am sending  this to you.  I apologize  for not sending  it directly  to \nthe legislature.  Please  assist  me in getting it before  the Committee  that will be considering  Ms. \nReed's  Board  Membership.  Mahalo.  M.Verdine  Kong  (808)268 -1414  \n \nMy name  is M. Verdine  Kong.  I am a retired  attorney.  In 2015,  I worked  part- time  for Parents  and \nChildren  Together  (PACT)  as a co-facilitator  of a Women's  Empowerment  Group  in Maui  Community  \nCorrectional  Center.  There,  I met a weekly  participant,  Tara  Reed.  Tara  impressed me as creative,  \ncompassionate,  and intelligent.  Moreover,  she was a good  listener,  respectful  and open to others'  \ninput  and ideas.  She actively  engaged  in group  discussions  and was willing  to share  her knowledge  \nwith  other  participants.  During  private  discussions,  I learned  that Ms Reed  earned  her Bachelor  of \nArts Degree in Social  Work  from  the University  of Hawai`i  at Manoa,  in 2009.  Previously,  she had \nbeen  diagnosed  to suffer  from  recurrent  depression,  severe  Post  Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  and \nanxiety  largely  stemming  from  a childhood  lacking  parental  involvement.  Ms. Reed  was not treated  \nfor these  issues  and began  self-medicating  with  drugs  and alcohol,  eventually  being  incarcerated  for \ndrug -related  offenses.  \n \nSince  Ms Reed's  release from  jail in 2015,  Tara  has achieved  success  as a thriving  mother,  \ncommunity  member and a friend  to many.  I am one of the fortunate  persons  who  has developed  a \ngrowing  friendship with  Tara.  This year,  Ms. Reed  will be celebrating  her 7th year  of sobriety. She \nidentifies  her role as a \"grass  roots  organizer  creating  working  relationships  with  Maui's  adult high - \nrisk population\u201d.  \n \nTara  has been  recognized  on Maui,  as a credible  representative  of the Mental  Health  community.  \nShe acts as a bridge  in communication  and services  to persons  suffering  from  a variety  of mental  \nhealth  concerns.  She seeks  to close  the gaps  between  persons  in need,  with  appropriate  resources.  \nShe has been  selected  to serve  on the Governor's  Area  Service  Board  for Mental  Health  and \nSubstance  Abuse  since  2018.  In this capacity,  Ms. Reed  has been  instrumental  in highlighting  the \nneed  for harm  reduction education.  In 2021,  Ms. Reed  completed  training  and became  certified  as \nan adult mental  health  division  peer  specialist.  In May,  2020,  Ms. Reed  was awarded  the Adult  \nMental  Health  Consumer  Advocate  by Mental  Health  America  of Hawai`i.  \n \nI firmly  believe that Ms. Reed  will be an asset  to the State  Board  on Mental  Health  because  she CAUTION:  This email  originated  from  outside of the organization.  Do not click  links  or open  attachments  unless  you \nrecognize  the sender  and know  the content is safe.  fulfills  an important component  in strengthening,  advocating  for, and encouraging  inclusion  of \nmembers  of our community  who  are challenged  by mental  health  issues.  She will share  her vision  of \nthose  with  mental  health  challenges  as persons  who  are significant  in strengthening  the fabric  of our \ncommunities.  \n \nI offer  my strong  support  to Ms. Reed  as Board  Member for the State  Board  on Mental  Health.  \nMahalo  for taking  the time  to consider  my testimony.  \n \nWith  aloha,  \n \nVerdine  Kong  \n(808)268 -1414 "},

I am \nwriting today to support the nomination of Diane Ley to t he Board of \nAgriculture.  \n \nDuring  and shortly after the 2018 Kilauea eruption, many of the orchid grow ers \nin Kapoho came togeth er to cooperatively see what could be done to help \nrestart the orchid industry which had been decimated by th e eruption.  While \nFederal, Sta te an d County agencies held vario us open meeting to address the \nconcerns of ci tizens, the orchid  grow ers needed to initiate their  own effort to \nget back in business.  \n \nDuring th is challenging pe riod, despite a very challenging schedule, Diane made \nit a point to attend the mee ting of the group  and pr ovided the  growers with \nexcellent guidance on steps to take to get back in bus iness.  This led to the \neventually  founding of the  Puna Flower Power cooperative which has \nsuccessfully bee n awarded several grants and State emergency loa ns to restart \nthe industry.  \n \nWe had the good fortune of hosting Senator Gabbard and his lively wife at the \nPFP nursery a few months ago and I am certain the he can attest  to th e success  \n \n2 of the  operat ion.

Why do you wish t o be a member of the Board of Agriculture?  \nIt\u2019s been an honor to serve for the last four years as the Kauai representative to the Board of Agriculture. We\u2019ve \ntake n on some very important issues affecting the agric ultural community in that time . I look for ward to working \ncollaboratively with the many stakeholders  on the critical issues facing our state to improve our sustainability by \nstrengthening our agricultural capacity.  \n \n2. How do you perceive the role and responsibilities of a member of the Board of Agri culture?  \nThe Board of Agriculture provides the Department of Agriculture with critical policy direction, weighing and making \ndecisions relative to specific authorities, which advance agriculture through the preservation and productive \ndeployment of the St ate\u2019s agricultural resources, as well as protect Hawai`i agriculture from harm and degradation. \nBoard of Agriculture members should serve as engaged and thoughtful participants in reviewing proposals and \ninitiatives; ask pertinent questions of applicants a nd Department staff; and reach decisions that are fair, equitable, \nand lawful.  \n \n3. Given your understanding of the role and responsibilities of a member of the Board of Agriculture, why do you \nbelieve that you are qualified for the position? Please include a  brief statement of your skills, expertise, or \nknowledge that would aid in your decision -making ability as a member of the Board of Agriculture.  \nI\u2019m primarily a businessman with a specialty in agriculture. During my 20 -year Air Force career I was planning  on \ncoming back to Hawaii to work in the family business in coffee. My time away from Hawaii in th e military not only \nfocused on doing my very best in the defense of our country but I also was studying the transition that Hawaii was \ngoing through with the steady decline of the sugar industry  and the renaissance within the coffee industry. I learned \nfirsthand  the value of teamwork and the value of collaborative problem solving. I believe my backgrou nd gives me a \nunique perspective on agriculture issues . I also deeply appreciate the importance significance of a well-run board in \nassisting the decision making on agricultural matters within our state . \n \n4. What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service ?  \nIf confirmed by the Senate, I anticipate collaboratively contributing to the Department\u2019s ability to advance and meet \nthe needs of the agricultural segment of our Hawaiian economy.  Our governor has established difficult yet \nimportant and attainable goal s for food production within our state by 2025. These goals will require the concerted \neffort of the private economy and the state. I would like to see better funding for agricultural programs within the \nstate as well as private initiatives that strengthen ou r productive capacity. I would also hope to encourage a new \ngeneration of agricultural entrepreneurs that will be able to leverage the best of our cherished cultural traditions \nwith the best new technology available.  Honorable Mike Gabbard,  \nChair Committ ee on Agriculture and Environment  \nRE: GM548 Nomination of Fred erick  Cowell to the Board of Agriculture April 7, 2022, Page 2  \n \n5. Name three qualities that best describe you and that would make you stand out. How would these qualities \nbenefit the Board of Agr iculture?  \nKnowledgeable  \u2013 I am knowledgeable about agriculture and ag issues across t our diverse state. I grew up mainly on \nOahu, re -entered civilian life on the Big Island , and have lived on Kauai since 2009. My first four -year  term on the \nBoard of Agriculture has given me a wonderful perspective on  its value and role. I\u2019m confident that I will be able to \nnot only increase my effectiveness but to also pass some of my knowledge onto others entering into a similar role.  \nDisciplin ed\u2013 I\u2019ve grown tremendously during my 20 -year military caree r and continue to seek personal growth \nduring my civilian career. I welcome the opportunities that come my way and view challenges as opportunities to \ngrow even further. Personal growth requires t he self-discipline  to grow through the challenges that are ever -present \nin our modern world. It requires discipline to carefully weigh the matters presented to the Board of Agriculture \nwithout making rash decisions.  \nServant Leader - We\u2019re called to serve f irst an d foremost. As a leader , I\u2019m called serve all those within my area  of \nresponsibility. Anything less would be self -serving.  I\u2019ve done my best to live and lead according to this quality for my \nentire career.  \n \n6. Name one previous experience that would make you stand out. How would this benefit the Board of Agriculture?  \nRather than cite  experiences from my civilian or military career, I choose to highlight my first four years on the Board \nof Agri culture. The Board of Agri culture brings together a broad c ross-section of expertise from across private and \npublic sectors. The capacity of the Board of Agriculture is derived from the collective expertise and backgrounds of \nall its members. Having served for the initial term, I feel I\u2019m more capable of understanding the needs of the \nagricultural community , the capabilities of the Department of Agriculture staff, and the process that underpins the \nBoard of Agriculture.  \n \n7. Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interests that could arise during your service on the Board of \nAgriculture? How would you overcome any possible conflicts of interest?   \nI must assume that ther e will be potential conflicts of interest associated with my role as a member of the Board of \nAgriculture  and my role as the general manager of Kauai Coffee Company, LLC .  I also serve on other Boards of \nDirectors of organ izations and non -profit entities w ithin the state. Nevertheless, if any conflict of interest were to \narise, I would announce such conflict and recuse myself from discussion, deliberation, and decision -making. As \nnecessary, this may include prior consultation with a state ethics officer or the Attorney General\u2019s Office via the \nChairperson\u2019s Office  "},

I am a professional planner and very familiar with the duties and \nresponsibil ities of this important authority . Not only does HCDA \u2019s jurisdiction include Kakaako, but it is \nresponsible for  Kalaeloa, and Heeia. I was City & County Planning Director for many years and was Vice -Chair \non the Barber\u2019s Point Realignment and Closure Commi ssion  which covers Kalaeloa . In all the work that HCDA \ndoes, wherever it goes, community involvement is key.  \nI have known Susan for more than two decades, from her time at KPMG and then Kamehameha Schools. I \nam impressed by her integrity, her commitment to  Hawaiian values, and her technical skills . I have the \ngreatest confidence in her ability to chair and lead the commission, seeking diverse views, and factoring all \nperspectives when making decisions.  and her team building . Her immersion in complex real es tate \ndevelopment brings a deep understanding of those dynamics , an understanding that is important to this \nauthority\u2019s work . But Susan  should not be seen as a \u201cdeveloper\u201d sympathizer , rather she has consistently \ndemonstrated a desire to reach out and work with community. This is what makes her stand out and what \nwill distinguish her as a commission member.  \nSusan and I are both long time members of Lambda Alpha International, a professional society dedicated to \nthe study of land economics. Susan is our curre nt Chapter President. She has brought a fresh perspective \nand enthusiasm to LAI, even developing a virtual hybrid \u201clunch\u201d program (lunches are delivered to \nparticipant homes during the zoom call) that emphasizes member engagement.  \nI am pleased to respond t o any questions you may have.  \nSincerely yours , \n \nCheryl D.

I am currently a \nDeputy  Prosec uting Attorney (\"DPA\"). I am submitting this supporting testimony in my personal \ncapacity.  \nWhen I met Adrian, he was a supervising DPA: the  Team Captain for the felony trial team that \nappeared before the Honorable Colette Y. Garibaldi. Even though I was ju st a judicial extern  for \nJudge Garibaldi at the time, Adrian was  always courteous to me. He was \nconsistently  professional yet approachable, never abrupt nor dismissive.  I became a DPA three \nmonths later and while  Adrian was never my supervisor, he became b oth a mentor and a friend. I \nam grateful that he  always took the  time to answer my questions,  give constructive feedback or \njust simply talk to me. To this day, although we no longer work at the same office, I am grateful \nto still consider him a mentor and  a friend.  His intelligence, legal  knowledge,  work ethic and \ndedication to public service all make him more than qualified to serve on the LESB. \nFurthermore, his lack of arrogance, ability to work with various members of the community  and \nhis strong sense of fairness  would make him an asset to the LESB.  \nThank you for the opportunity to submit testimony in support of Adrian.  \n Cheuk\u00a0Fu\u00a0Lui\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0CF.Lui@outlook.com \u00a0\u00a0\n(808)\u00a0223\u20103494\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nBefore\u00a0the\u00a0Senate\u00a0Committee\u00a0on\u00a0Public\u00a0Safety,\u00a0\nIntergovernmental,\u00a0and\u00a0Military\u00a0Affairs\u00a0\nOn\u00a0Measure\u00a0GM\u00a0562\u00a0\u2013\u00a0\u00a0\nConfirmation\u00a0of\u00a0Laxmi\u00a0Adrian\u00a0Dhakhwa\u00a0to\u00a0LESB\u00a0\u2013\u00a0 Written\u00a0Testimony\u00a0in\u00a0Strong\u00a0Support \u00a0\n\u00a0\nChair\u00a0Nishihara\u00a0and\u00a0Members\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Committee:\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0write\u00a0in\u00a0STRONG\u00a0SUPPORT\n\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0confirmation\u00a0of\u00a0Laxmi\u00a0\u201cAdrian\u201d\u00a0Dhakhwa\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Law\u00a0\nEnforcement\u00a0Standards\u00a0Board\u00a0(\u201cLESB\u201d).\u00a0\n\u00a0 It\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0a\u00a0tremendous\u00a0privilege\u00a0to\u00a0work\u00a0with,\u00a0and\u00a0learn\u00a0fro m,\u00a0Adrian.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0known\u00a0Adrian\u00a0\nfor\u00a0more\u00a0than\u00a010\u00a0years,\u00a0as\u00a0my\u00a0sup ervisor,\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0colleague,\u00a0and\u00a0a s\u00a0a\u00a0friend.\u00a0\u00a0Adrian\u00a0is\u00a0well\u2010known\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0an\u00a0\nextremely\u00a0competent,\u00a0fair,\u00a0and\u00a0diligent\u00a0prosecutor.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0have\u00a0see n\u00a0firsthand\u00a0how\u00a0diligent\u00a0and\u00a0prepared\u00a0\nAdrian\u00a0is\u00a0for\u00a0each\u00a0and\u00a0every\u00a0cas e\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0investigates\u00a0and\u00a0pros ecutes.\u00a0\u00a0Coupled\u00a0with\u00a0his\u00a0years\u00a0of\u00a0\nexperience,\u00a0Adrian\u00a0is\u00a0uniquely\u00a0qualified\u00a0to\u00a0serve\u00a0on\u00a0LESB\u00a0becau se\u00a0he\u00a0is\u00a0intimately\u00a0familiar\u00a0with\u00a0law\u00a0\nenforcement\u00a0procedures\u00a0and\u00a0standa rds,\u00a0but\u00a0without\u00a0being\u00a0a\u00a0part\u00a0 of\u00a0the\u00a0\u201cculture\u201d\u00a0or\u00a0\u201cthe\u00a0thin\u00a0blue\u00a0line\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0\nHaving\u00a0practiced\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0state\u2010wide\u00a0 prosecutor,\u00a0as\u00a0opposed\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0co unty\u00a0prosecutor,\u00a0Adrian\u00a0has\u00a0experience\u00a0\nacross\u00a0all\u00a0agencies\u00a0i n\u00a0this\u00a0State\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0nuances\u00a0betwe en\u00a0them.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Most\u00a0importantly,\u00a0Adrian\u00a0is\u00a0fai r\u00a0and\u00a0very\u00a0diligent.\u00a0\u00a0Adrian\u00a0is \u00a0more\u00a0than\u00a0capable\u00a0to\u00a0analyze\u00a0the\u00a0\nfacts,\u00a0objectively\u00a0apply\u00a0those\u00a0fa cts,\u00a0and\u00a0make\u00a0fair\u00a0recommendations.\u00a0\u00a0His\u00a0reputation\u00a0of\u00a0being\u00a0fair\u00a0and\u00a0\ndiligent\u00a0will\u00a0not\u00a0only\u00a0make\u00a0him\u00a0a n\u00a0excellent\u00a0board\u00a0member,\u00a0but\u00a0 it\u00a0will\u00a0also\u00a0bring\u00a0credibility\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0board.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 Adrian\u00a0is\u00a0well\u2010qualified\u00a0to\u00a0serve \u00a0on\u00a0LESB.\u00a0\u00a0His\u00a0experience\u00a0and \u00a0capabilities\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0great\u00a0assets\u00a0for\u00a0\nthe\u00a0board.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0strongly\u00a0support\u00a0the\u00a0confirmation\u00a0of\u00a0Adrian\u00a0to\u00a0LE SB.\u00a0\u00a0Thank\u00a0you\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0opportunity\u00a0to\u00a0\ntestify.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRespectfully,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nCheuk\u00a0Fu\u00a0Lui\u00a0\nGM-562 \nSubmitted on: 4/8/2022 6:03:55 PM  \nTestimony for PSM on 4/12/2022 1:00:00 PM  \nSubmitted By  Organization  Testifier Position  Testify  \nRobert Kelly  Individual  Support  Written Testimony \nOnly  \n \n \nComments:  \nThis testimony is for Laxmi Adrian Dhakhwa for confirmation to the Law Enforcement \nStandards Board.    \n  \nMy name is Robert Kelly and I have known Laxmi for over 25 years, starting in 1994 at \nWhitman College where we both received our undergraduate degrees.    \n  \nAt Whitman College, Laxmi displayed a strong moral and ethical standard and I have observed \nthis in his academic, professional, and personal life during and after his time there.   He displayed \nan interest in promoting fairness and equity in society fro m very early on.   He has always been \ninterested in helping those in need.   As a health care professional, I am surrounded by many \ncaring people on a daily basis, and I see many of these same caring traits such as empathy, \ncompassion, and a desire to better  society in Laxmi.    \n  \nAs someone who has known him personally for so long, I believe him to be a trustworthy and \ndependable individual who would work tirelessly to ensure the best outcome for the state of \nHawaii and its citizens.    \n  \nHe has always taken a measured and fair approach to difficult questions and challenges.   I have \nobserved in him a considerate and respectful approach to communicating with people from \ndifferent positions and from people who hail from many different backgro unds.   He is highly \nadept at understanding different cultures and he has always demonstrated a desire to see different \nperspectives to help him achieve the best and most equitable outcome.    \n  \nHe is hard working and passionate about this position.   In my a cademic and personal discussions \nwith him over the years, I can testify to his strong moral values and his keen understanding of law enforcement from his professional career.   I would like to strongly recommend him for this \nposition on the Law Enforcement Standards Board.    \n  \nThank you for your time.  \n  \nSincerely,  \nDr. Robert H Kelly  \n April 6, 2022\nSen.

I have known Adrian for over 30 years, since our high school days at William \nMcKinley High School.   Over the course of the past 30 years, I've had the p rivilege of seeing \nAdrian grow from the smart and hardworking teenager he was, to the still ever hardworking and \ncaring Husband and Father he is today.  \nMore importantly to this matter at hand, as friends, I've had the opportunity to engage in many \ndiscussi ons and discourses at bbqs, birthday parties, and other events, where I've been able to see \nand better understand first hand the type of person he is, and his genuine character. What I've \ncome to know of Adrian is that he is not only extremely smart, logic al and honest, but also very \nmeasured and fair in his thought process.   He is not one to rush to judgement, but rather takes in \nas much information as he can, and reserves opinion or judgement (if any) until he has the full \npicture. These are the qualities  that I would hope and want for any LESB Member to have.  \nAbove all this, what impresses me most about Adrian is his heart and his determination to keep \nour islands safe and make it a better place for his kids and the next generation.   I sense in him a \nvery genuine desire to serve his community and society.   For that these reasons, I firmly believe \nhe would make a great board member and a positive addition to the LESB.  \nSincerely,  \nLinh Lopez  \n April 9, 2022  \n \nSenator Clarence K.

We had several cases against each \nother, and I observed his determination and skill in prosecuting cases  with utmost vigor \nand diligence .  At the same time,  even while we were engaged in the heat of battle, he \nalways  conducted himself in the most forthrigh t and straightforward  manner possible, \nconsistent with the highest standards of professional conduct of his office  and of the \nHawaii State Bar Association .

Although I am now currently employed as a police officer for the \nHonolulu Police D epartment, I first met Mr. Dhakhwa while I was employed as a Criminalist in \nthe Honolulu Police Department\u2019s Scientific Investigation Section between 2005 and 2013, and \nMr. Dhakhwa served as a Deputy Prosecuting Attorney for the City & County of Honolulu \nDepartment of the Prosecuting Attorney. It was in the formative years of my professional \ndevelopment that I developed my opinion of Mr. Dhakhwa. I found him to be intelligent, hard -\nworking, and fair in his treatment of both victims and suspects. I also foun d his enthusiasm for \nhis work and tenacity in bringing closure to his cases to be respectable, and comforting in \nknowing that we had prosecutors such as Mr. Dhakhwa who did their best for the people of \nHawaii. Mr. Dhakhwa has always been professional and c ourteous in dealing with others, and I \ncan think of no better person to deal with the current issues faced by Hawaii\u2019s law enforcement, \nand which need to be addressed by a Law Enforcement Standards Board. His levelheaded \nthinking and many positive attribut es would serve him well in any professional capacity, \nhowever, I feel that they would be of particular benefit for a position such as this. In light of \nthese observations, please let me offer my humble recommendation for the nomination of Mr. \nDhakhwa to th e Law Enforcement Board. Thank you very much for your time and consideration.  \n  \nSincerely,  \nDavid Esaki, Sergeant  \nHonolulu Police Department  \nCriminal Investigation Division  \nSex Crimes Detail  \n The Honorable Clarence K.

As a highly experienced prosecutor \u2013 and longstanding Team Captain for the \nDepartment\u2019s Felony Trial Division \u2013 Mr. Dhakhwa has dedicated h imself as a public servant for \nover 20 years to the City and State as not just a prosecutor  or attorney general , but as a mentor \nand role model for past and present deputies.  I have had the pleasure to work with , observe , and \nexpe rience  his leadership, as he worked as a deputy prosecuting attorney and my team captain in \nthe Felony Trial Division.  I have always known him to be honest, straightforward  and \npassionate about serving the State of Hawaii as a deputy prosecuting attorney and attorney \ngeneral .  His professionalism and dedication to the State of Hawaii through service has always \nbeen respected  and will undoubtedly be fine character traits as a member of the Law \nEnforcement Standards Board.     \n I have no doubt that Mr. Dhakhwa\u2019 s even keel demeanor , attention to detail,  and moral \ncompass of doing the right thing  will allow him to effectively contribute to creating programs \nand standards for training and certification  for current and future  law enforcement officers.  His \nexperience and legal knowledge will be of utmost value to the Law Enforcement Standard Board \nand to the people of the State of Hawaii .   \n For all the forgoing reasons, I strongly support  the confirmation of LAXMI DHAKHWA  \nto the Law Enforcement Standards Board , pursuant to G.M. 562.

Mr. Dhakhwa has been an instrumental  mentor in my \ncareer, demonstrating patience and understanding when I was a n ew attorney, as well as camaraderie \nas the years have passed.  He  has always been someone I have looked up to as a prosecutor and a \nperson.  Mr. Dhakhwa has handled some of the most serious cases in Honolulu with intelligence, \ndiligence, and an eye towards  justice.  \n \nThe Law Enforcement Standards Board is an important step towards standardizing police conduct, \nproviding accountability for misconduct, and increasing the public\u2019s trust in law enforcement.  I am \nconfident that Mr. Dhakhwa would serve in further ance of those ends with the same traits that have \nmade him a successful  prosecutor.

I've known Adrian \nfor over 20 years and can speak very strongly to his character.   Adrian expects  honesty of his \nfriends, his children, and most importantly himself.   There's a lot of great things I can say about \nAdrian, his family, the people that he associates with, etc.   It all boils down to this though.   Our \npolice force in Hawaii is part of our c ommunity.   We should be able to trust without question \nthat when police are needed, they are acting with our safety and well being in mind.   Our police \nforce should be a sense of pride for every person that calls Hawaii home.   Although this will boil \ndown to the individual decision making of each member of the police force, a strong \ncommitment to a clear and simple set of standards will help when decisions have to be made.   I \ntrust noone more than Adrian to help to shape those standards and apply them.   It's a critically \nimportant job, and I know that Adrian will see it as that, and will work beyond what is expected \nof him to see to it that the Law Enforcement community has a simple, clear and easy to apply set \nof standards to operate by.  \n "},

My name is Donna Shimizu and I was born and raised on the Big Island with a  family \nhistory of military involvement and commitment.   I myself have served 35 honorable years with \nthe Hawaii Air National Guard.  \nI have been attending virtual Advisory Board on Veterans' Services meetings for the past eight \nmonths, getting acquainted with conduct and procedures.   I have also been attending the East \nHawaii Veterans organization meetings  to listen to updates and concerns from various veteran \ngroups.  \nI feel I am abl e to be an effective and efficient voice for veterans and it would be my honor and \nprivilege to be given the opportunity to serve as an advocate for them.  \n  \n TESTIMONY GM563 Submitting for Consideration and Confirmation  To the Advisory Board on Veterans\u2019 Services, Gubernatorial Nominee, DONNA N. SHIMIZU for a term to expire 6-30-2023  PRESENTATION TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY, INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND MILITARY AFFAIRS BY MS. CORIN KIM  April 6, 2022  Chair Nishihara, Vice Chair DeCoite, and members of the Committee:   I am Corin Kim, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) Coordinator for a program at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at Hilo as well as Mrs. Shimizu\u2019s eldest daughter.  I appreciate this opportunity to provide comments in support of Donna N. Shimizu to the State Advisory Board on Veterans Services, for a term to expire 6-30-2023.  I am sure other testimony from colleagues of my mom can attest to how she possesses the drive, work ethic, and experience that will add value to the State Advisory Board on Veterans\u2019 Services and the community the Board aims to serve. I am writing to attest to her character and dedication that I feel will benefit the Board and community.   For my whole life, my mom has been involved in her community and daughters\u2019 lives, while still heavily committed to her work for those who serve our country. Her military training was reflected in my upbringing, as her home valued discipline, honesty, and structure. I was raised to use initiative when completing tasks, follow through with commitments, and have integrity in my daily life. Although I am no longer a child, those values and lessons are ingrained in me, just as they continue to be pillars in her life.   As an adult, I now understand the weight of the commitment and sacrifices my mom made. When she works with veterans, those who are currently enlisted, their families, and the community, I see the passion she has and the willingness to give of her time, when many others might have felt it was \u201cno longer their responsibility\u201d. She continues to go the extra mile, even when she is retired, and I even still hear her trying to recruit people to the Air National Guard in casual conversation because she has such a deep level of respect for the uniform.  I understand testimony from a close family member may be assumed to hold bias, but I truly feel my mom will bring a valuable voice and add another reliable person to your Board, allowing all of you to better service your communities. Thank you for your time.   Corin Kim, corink@hawaii.edu, (808) 345-8341 "},

Building on the \u02bbAha P\u016bnana Leo\u2019s 39 years of work to reestablish a 100% Hawaiian\nlanguage medium education, I am working to sustain and expand its foundational program, the P\u016bnana\nLeo preschools, and create innovative platforms to further normalize \u02bb\u014dlelo Hawai\u02bbi in our daily lives.\nI am a graduate of Kamehameha Schools and hold a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in business\nadministration with a major in finance as well as a master\u2019s degree in business administration.

Our family gatherings\nremain great memories for me and I am raising my own children with these same values. Upon\ngraduation from Kamehameha where Hawaiian language learning was a natural fit for me, I pursued my\ndegrees in areas of interest however I longed for the opportunity to live and use \u02bb\u014dlelo Hawai\u02bbi in daily\nlife. Becoming the CEO of \u02bbAha P\u016bnana Leo is a calling I feel that merges my business talents with my\nlove of my k\u016bpuna and honoring my ancestors and being able to support the mission and vision of \u02bbAha\nP\u016bnana Leo.\nDuring my tenure, my goal is to provide just representation of the Hawaiian language medium education\npathway to ensure quality and fairness in the state early learning systems.

I was privileged to\nwork alongside Kristi as a fellow educator for the past three years as a 7th grade team teacher .\nDuring that time, she was able to both impress me as a teacher and continue to establish herself as a\ndedicated, thoughtful and student centered educator within our team and school.\nKristi is the type of person who goes above and beyond for her students. She makes it a\npoint to create lessons and learning opportunities that both engage and make students critically\nthink about what they are learning so they are able to internalize the concepts.

You can feel her\ngenuine desire for her students to thrive and the time and ef fort she puts into teaching when you\nwalk in her classroom. She makes herself available to her students during her free time and\nregularly has students in her classroom during recess, lunch and afterschool working on\nassignments or club activities.

I wrote a recommendation when she applied for the interim \nposition. This letter duplicates, but expands on the letter I wrote w hen she applied to finish a \nprevious member\u2019s term last year.  I have had occasion to work with Principal Soares multiple \ntimes over the past six years, most especially as she implemented elements of the What School \nCould Be \u201cInnovation Playlist\u201d in collabo ration with all Molokai public and charter schools. Her \nunderstanding of what school could be, what teaching could be is remarkable and visionary, She \nunderstands what it means for kids to be most likely to succeed. She also understands what \nteachers need to do to prepare themselves to guide, coach, mentor and sponsor today\u2019s kids as \nthey navigate towards a set of \u201cdurable skills\u201d and social and emotional competencies, especially \nduring this C19 pandemic.  Moreover, Principal Soares truly understands what it  will take to \nshape the next generation of teachers. The skills, habits and dispositions these teachers will need \nto support student -centered, real world learning Principal Soares knows well. Her faculty \nmembers have been on the cutting edge of student voi ce, student agency, teacher collaboration \nand intentional school design since she returned to Molokai to assume the position of principal. \nHer work pulling the entire Molokai community together to explore the \u201cprofile of a Molokai \ngraduate\u201d is, in my opini on, a model of what innovative leadership looks, sounds and feels like. \nShe knows well that our challenge in the years ahead is to invest in the human capital that is our \npublic school teachers.

She is a \u201ccan do\u201d \nperson with the gift of bringing people together for the common good. She has a way of finding \nfunds through collaborative efforts which makes dre ams come true for those who come to her \nfor guidance and assistance.   \nI would like to impress upon the committee that most of Pauline N amuo\u2019s work in the \ncommunity and universally has been given freely, from the heart, without compensation. She \nemphasizes that \u201cif our objectives are the right objectives premised on doing good, then by \nhelping those objectives become realities well leave a legacy.\u201d  \nI ask this committee to allow Pauline Namuo to \u201cleave a legacy of doing good\u201d as a \ncommissioner on the Hawaiian  Homes Commission by passing GM577.  Mahalo  \n \n \n \n Testimony of Oriana Leao \nTo the Senate Committee on Hawaiian Affairs (HWN)  \nIn SUPPORT  of Gubernatorial Nominee, PAULINE NAMU\u2018O for confirmation to the Hawaiian \nHomes Commission  (GM 5 77) \n \nMarch 3, 2022  \n1:15pm  \n \n \nAloha Chair Shimabukuro, Vice  Chair K eohokalole , and m embers of the Committee,  \n \nI am writing in support of Governor\u2019s Message 577 and I ask that you confirm Pauline \nNamu\u2018o to the Hawaiian Homes Commission . \nPauline Namu\u2018o is a Native Hawaiian woman whose mana (spiritual power) and resume \nspeak s louder than most will hear her speak in most  Hawaiian Homes Commission meeting s.  \nNamu\u2018o fully understands the kuleana  (responsibilities) of a Hawaiian Homes Commissioner and \nthe potency of her leo (voice) is strategically us ed to advocate for beneficiaries of the Hawaiian \nHomes Commission Act and to support the work of the Department of H awaiian H ome L ands. \nShe is the knowledge that knows what needs to be said and she is the wisdom that knows when \nto speak on that knowledge. \n \nNamu\u2018o holds a position that represents the island of O\u2018ahu -a-Lua, which is reflected in \nher service in leadership with the YWCA of Oahu -  Board of Directors, the Kalihi- Palama \nHawaiian Civic Club, and the \u2018Ahahui Ka\u2018ahumanu, Chapter I  in Honolulu. Namu\u2018o currently \nrepresents one of a few wahine commissioners on the HHC and has advocated for women in the Organization of Women Leaders and the American Business  Women\u2019s Association. \n Namu\u2018o holds a keen understanding of the nuances between and among the e xecutive, \njudicial, and l egislative branches of government  and she was adamant about appealing  the 2021 \ndecision  concerning the  Nelson v. Hawaiian Homes Commission case. O ne of Namu\u2018o\u2019s  \nstrongest suits  is her ability to network  among community civic clubs  in conjunction with \ngovernment efforts  and her broad range of expertise and insight in to the innerworkings of how to \nmake the almost i nsurmountable very possible is why the Hawaiian Homes Commission will \nneed her in the years to come. \n \nMahalo for considering this testimony in strong support of Gubernatorial Nominee, \nPauline Namu \u2018o for confirmation to the Hawaiian Homes Commission.  \n \n \n COMMITTEE ON HAWAIIAN AFFAIRS TO:  Senator Maile S.L.

I am a native Hawaiian, a beneficiary of the Trust (O\u02bbahu Residential Waitlist \n#7320), raised on a homestead in Hoolehua, Molokai.   \n Public service in any area is no small feat, but a volunteer policy- maker for the \nbetterment of native Hawaiians is special. Commissioners are asked to accomplish an \nalmost impossible task, affecting thousands of native Hawaiians and their familial legacies. With limited resources and a growing beneficiary class, the charge is daunting.  \n \nThrough her service on the Hawaiian Homes Commiss ion for the past four years, \nPauline Namuo has  proven herself a worthy advocate  of the Trust's benef iciaries and \ncontinue s to do her best to improve the policies that affect them.   \n I strongly support the confirmation of Pauline Namuo as a Hawaiian Home s \nCommissioner .  \n Leatrice W.

Please confirm Pauline Namuo for another \nterm.  \n GM 577 TESTIMONY OF JOBIE MASAGATANI IN STRONG SUPPORT OF \nCONF IRMING THE APPOINTMENT OF PAULINE NAMUO TO THE HAWAIIAN \nHOMES COMMISSION  \n \nMy name is Jobie Masagatani, and while I am a currently a staff member at the Department of \nHawaiian Home Lands, I am testifying today as an individual in  my personal capacity.   \nI submit this testimony in STRONG SUPPORT  of confirming Pauline Namuo to serv e as a \nCommissioner on the Hawaiian Homes Commission  for another term .   \nI had the opportunity to serve with Pauline on the Hawaiian Homes Commission  (HHC) during \nmy time as Chair , and I continue to work with her in this new role as a member of DHHL\u2019s  Exec utive \nManagement team.  Few realize how diverse and complicated the issues are that come before the \nCommission on a monthly basis.  Issues can range from the very specific dynamics within a family to long \nterm policy issues at the federal level.  Pauline l istens,  reviews the materials , and considers all sides of \nthe issues that are brought before her  as a Commissioner .  I don\u2019t consider her the type of board \nmember that feels the need to speak on every issue just to be \u201cheard\u201d.  Thus, when she does speak up , \npeople pay attention to her contributions and feedback.  \nPauline is thoughtful, dedicated, and committed .  In addition to the monthly meetings, Pauline \nhas served on temporary HHC committees  (permitted interaction groups) that take a deeper dive into \ncomp lex issues before the Commission.  These committee s investigate, discuss, and develop \nrecommendations to help inform the Commission .

Another 308 students came to Hawai\u2019i  for graduate education through WICHE\u2019s \nWestern Regional Graduate Program, or WRGP.  \n Dr. Lassner is a dedicated and committed leader. He currently serves as Chair of the WICHE Commission , a position to which he was elected by his peers throughout the West. Through his \ndedicated leadership, he provides steady guidance and valuable input on matters of importance \nto Hawai\u02bbi and the entire region.  \n For example, President Lassner led a change  to WICHE\u2019s  WRGP  that has resulted in expanded \neducational opportunities for graduate education for not only Hawai\u2019i  students but for students \nthroughout the region.  \n \nPresident Lassner represented Hawai\u2019i in the formative stages of what became WCET -  the \nWICHE Cooperative for Educational Technologies - and twice served as its Steering Committee \nChair. His expertise in using technologies to serve students gave Hawai\u2019i an outsized leadership voice in EDUCAUSE, Internet2, and open software projects, and his po sitive impact continues to \nbe felt today.  \n As of July 2021, WICHE welcomed the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia into WICHE membership. This is a historical moment for both WICHE and the Pacific region by expanding acc ess to postsecondary education for many students who  may  not \nhave previously had opportunities  to affordably access undergraduate and graduate programs \nthroughout the West. As we bring our new colleagues into WICHE, President Lassner has been \ninstrumental in ensuring that the process is smooth and respectful  to our new partners . \n In my role, I work closely with President Lassner to ensure that WICHE is as effective as it can be. I am grateful for his guidance and partnership, and it is an honor to speak in support of his \nreappointment today.  \n Thank you for your time and consideration . \n  \n  \n  March 2 8, 2022  \nSenator Donna M ercado Kim, Chair  \nSenator Michelle N. Kidani, Vice Chair  \nHawaii Senate Committee on Higher Education  \n \nRe: Testimony in Support of the Appointment of David Lassner as a WICHE Commissioner  \nDear Senator Kim, my name is Colleen O\u2019Brien Sathre, I\u2019m retired Vice President Emeritus, Planning \nand Policy, University of Hawaii.  It is a privilege and honor to testify in support of Dr. David Lassner \ncontinuing as a WICHE commissioner.  \n \nWICHE is a partnership among Western and Pacific states, U.S Pacific Territories and F reely Associ ated \nStates.  WICHE accomplishments are many and are described in its annual report and other publications \nthat provide regional and state  information about WICHE programs that bene fit students, families and  \nthe larger community . Each state has three  WICHE commissioners.  \n \nUH President David Lassner is currently the chair of the WICHE Commission.  I will be brief and limit my \nsupport for David\u2019s appointment by commenting on the following question:  \u201cWhat is it about David \nLassner that makes others want him as a leader? \u201d \n  \nBased on observation s others have shared  and my own experience, the answer is that he brings to any \nissue intelligence and humility . These q ualities result in someone who :  \n\u2022 deals with complexity in order to advance understanding with no hint of condescension;  \n\u2022 understands and acts to put the good of the whole first ; \n\u2022 is self-effacing and willing to do the work ; and   \n\u2022 has a great sensitivity for culture  and community .  \nIn short,  he is a person of integrity and character,  and those he interacts with take notice  very quickly.    \n \nI have observed in many different settings that,  despite his quiet demean or, others appreciate David\u2019s \nability  to articulate the issue, share relevant background, assumptions, and alternatives , and suggest \npossible actions . Others perceive a leader  in their midst.  Having served on the WICHE committee \ncharged with nominating the next vice chair, I kn ow firsthand that fellow WICHE commissioners sought \nhis leadership as Commission chair at least twice until he  was able to agree to adding on the  chair \nresponsibility and not diminish his presidential responsibilities . Hawaii and our Pacific and Western \ncolleagues are blessed to have him in both roles . \n \nHawaii is very fortunate that David Lassner chose to  follow a career in technology leadership that has \nevolved over the years , giving our Aloha State one of the best university presidents in the country. I do \nnot make that statement lightly.  \n \nI strongly recommend that President  David  Lassner be appointed to the WICHE Commission.   \n \nBest regards and appreciation for the work you do for our State,  \nColleen O. Sathre , Ph.D.  \nWICHE Commissioner  \n Sent via email to n.bernal@capitol.hawaii.gov  \n "},

Most recently, for the State of Hawai\u02bbi, she was the Director of Hawai\u02bbi University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities, Training, Service and Research (UCEDD) at the Center on Disability Studies at University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa for 4 years running numerous projects to improving the lives of people with disabilities across the lifespan. Her project included working with teachers and families to ensure that they understand the importance of the transition plan and that transition activities were included in the students\u2019 individual education plan. She has also worked to educate employers about disability issues and took on project to improve the accessibility and availability of accessible housing for individuals with disabilities.  Prior to coming to Hawai\u02bbi, she served as the President of the U.S. International Council on Disabilities (2014- 2016), Commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) from August 2001 till January 2009, and she was a senior associate at Booz Allen Hamilton where she provided consulting services to federal agencies, especially on accessibility in technology.

I have known Dr. Morrissey for about 8 years.  I  \nhave worked with her in her capacity as the Director of the Center on Disability Studies at the  \nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa. Dr. Morrissey is very resourceful, knowledgeable about  \nlegislation, well networked in the disability community, extremely professional, and will bring a  \ntremendous amount of experience to the position. Being a person with a disability, Pat will bring  \ninsight and direct experience in the challenges experienced in voting in the past that will assist  \nthe committee to address important issues to help make voting accessible and inclusive. What  \nimpresses me most about Dr. Morrissey is her depth of knowledge and her experience in  \ndeveloping f ederal and state disability policy. Specifically, she was instrumental in drafting the  \nAmericans with Disabilities Education Act of 1990 with Congressman Steve Bartlett.  Directly  \nrelated to the nomination of this committee, she was the senior federal of ficial responsible for  \nimplementing and evaluating the disability provisions in the Help America Vote Act.  \n \nShe has important recommendations a of how to address improving participation in the voting  \nprocess for individuals with disabilities that are sou nd and make sense. She raised the following  \ntwo concerns:  (1) the absence of any funding for the committee\u2019s work and (2) the exclusion of  \nany reference people with intellectual disabilities are critical and insightful. Dr. Morrissey is a  \ndoer and focu ses on what should be done to improve things and does not dwell on obstacles and  \nchallenges. These two issues already raised by her will make a positive impact in the work of the  \ncommittee. I highly recommend that Dr. Morrissey be appointed to the Statewide Voters with  \nSpecial Needs Advisory Committee.  \n \n- Kelle Murphy                 * Offering a world of support to families of children with disabilities *\nA Partnership Between the Disability & Communication Access Board and the Department of Education                  March 15, 2022\nSenator Karl Rhoads, Chair\nCommittee on JudiciaryHawaii State CapitolHonolulu, HI  96813\nRE:  GM 590 - Submitting for consideration and confirmation to the Statewide V oters With Special \n \n  Needs \nAdvisory Committee, Gubernatorial Nominee, PATRICIA MORRISSEY , for \n \n  a term to expire 06-30-2025\nDear Chair Rhoads and Members of the Committee: As the coordinator of a parent to parent program for parents of children and young adults with \ndisabilities, I have had the pleasure of working with Ms. Morrissey for the last decade and would like to highly recommend her for confirmation to the Statewide \nV oters with Special Needs Advisory \nCommittee.  \nMs. Morrissey has had an exceptional career, both in Washington, D.C. and in Hawaii.

Pat \nMorrisssey for consideration and confirmation to the Statewide V oters With Special \nNeeds Advisory Committee. I have known Dr . Morrissey for some years in my role as \nEditor-in-Chief of the\nReview of Disability Studies\njournal, where she is Distinguished \nFellow , and in her previous capacity as Director of the Center on Disability Studies at \nthe University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa, as well as her present role as President of the US\nInternational Council on Disabilities. Given her extensive legislative experience and her\nyears of demonstrated and active, continued commitment to serving the needs of those\nwith disabilities, she is uniquely qualified to serve in this role, and I wholeheartedly\nendorse her candidacy .\nIn her legislative experience, she has demonstrated the necessary leadership to work\npragmatically with allies and decision-makers to achieve identified priorities. There are \nfew Americans with comparable experience impacting legislation to better the lives of\nthose with disabilities, both in the US as well as globally . This includes service as \nCommissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities in the US \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, and over 20 years in senior staf f positions \nin the Executive Branch of the U.S. Government and in Congress. Additionally , working \nwithin the George W . Bush Administration, she was part of the US delegation to the UN \nduring drafting of Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nIn addition to her extensive previous experience, she also has demonstrated a\ncontinued commitment to empowering others to have greater access to legislation, a\ncommitment that continues to to the present. As recent as last month, she generously \naccepted an invitation on behalf of the Center on Disability Studies at the University of\nHawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa to provide a masterclass of her legislative experience in a capacity\nbuilding institute on interfacing with legislators, entitled \u201cLegislation Toolkit\u201d that she \ncontributed to the 100s of global attendees during the 37th Annual Pacific Rim\n2500 Campus RdHonolulu, HI 96822808-956-8111An Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Institution\nUNIVERSITY*ifofHAWAl'l\"\nMANQAInternational Conference on Disability and Diversity at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at\nM\u0101noa on February 26, 2022.

Morrissey in her advisory capacity with the\nReview of \nDisability Studies\n, where she serves as Distinguished\nFellow . She can be counted on to \ngive insightful, generous advice for the direction of the journal and its service to\ninternational readers around issues of disabilities. Her pragmatic and strategic insights\nhave been crucial to the ongoing success of the journal and its service to its global\nreadership.\nGiven Dr .

They , like all other voters , deserve the right to \naccess independently the voting process and cast their ballots.  \n \nUntil August 2020, I was Director of the Center on Disability Studies at the University of \nHawa ii. This is a nationally and internationally recognized resource . It conducts  research, \ndemonstration s, and training related to people with disabilities. Many individuals with \ndisabilities and their families have benefited from the work of the center . As the result \nof this work, Hawaii residents with disabilities and their families have experience d \ngreater opportunities and more inclusion in all aspects of community life.  \n \nCurrently , I am an active volunteer. I am president of the U .S International Coun cil on \nDisabilities , and also , serve on the board of two parent -directed nonprofit organizations  \nin Hawaii , Leadership in Disabilities and Achievement of Hawaii and Fuller Lives.  Prior to \nmoving to Hawaii , I held numerous positions in the federal executive  and congressional \nbranches of government . I played a leadership role in drafting all major federal dis ability  \nlegislation from 1981 through 2000.  Beginning in 2002 through 2008 , I was the federal \nofficial responsible for overseeing the implementation of t he disability provisions in the \nHelp America Vote Act.  \n \nFor the record , I have cerebral palsy, a mobility impairment, and use a scooter to get \naround. Thank you for allowing me to appear before you today via Zoom. I greatly \nappreciate the accommodation.   \nIn my testimony I would like to make three points . \nFirst,  the scope of the committee\u2019s mandate is clear . The legislation states \u201cThe purpose \nof the advisory committee is to ensure equal and independent access to voter \nregistration, casting of ballots, and all other office of elections services.\u201d  Nonetheless, \nsome critical components require discussion and consensus in order to facilitate the \ncommittee\u2019s work.    \nThe text of the legislation only refers to physical disabilities and references spec ifically \nvisual and hearing impairments. I would hope the Committee\u2019s mission will be allowed \nalso to address  the needs of those with mental and cognitive disabilities.  \nThe legislation indicates that for administrative purposes the Committee falls under the \nOffice on Elections . Does that mean that the Committee will have staff and financial \nsupport from that office? Such support is vital to the credibility of the Committee and its \nability to accomplish its purpose s. \nSecond, the Committee  need s to establish a baseline on the number of people with \ndisabilities who are voters so we can measure progress thereafter.  The federal Center \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, based on data collected in 2019, estimates \nthat there are 258,555 people wi th disabilities over 18 years of age  living in Hawaii. This \ninformation is further broken down to show tha t 10% of those people have a mobility \nimpairment, 10% have a cognition impairment, 5% have challenges living independently, \n6% have a hearing impairme nt, 4% have  a vision impairment , and 3% have challenges \nrelated to self -care.  There is no data available to show how many of these individuals  \nare registered voters . If the Statewide Voters with Special Needs Committee w ere to  \nundertake a survey of people with disabilities in Hawaii , that would be an invaluable \ncontribution  to our understanding of how well our election process is accessible to \npeople with disabilities.  \n \nThird, w hen we have secured the direct involvement of people with disabilities in the \nwork of the committee, such as through a survey and other activities, we will have a \nfoundation  for dialogue between elected officials and voters  with disabiliti es. We will \nimpro ve civic engagement. N eeded changes in state policies can be pursued through \ninformed consensus and opportunities for people with disabilities can be expanded.  \nPerhaps, what we implement here will be an attractive option for other states \ninterested in incr easing civic engagement among th eir voters with disabilities . \n \nIn closing, I would once again like to thank you for this opportunity and to also thank \nDaintry Bartoldus, Executive Administrator of the Governor \u2019s State Coun cil on \nDevelopmental Disabilities , and Louis Erte schik, Executive Director,  of the Hawaii Disability Rights Center , for nominating me to be a member of the Hawaii Statewide \nVoters  with Special Needs Advisory Committee.  \n \nI welcome any questions you may have.  \n \nContact Information:  \nPATRICIA MORRISSEY  \n1288 Kapiolani Blvd., Unit 3104  \nHonolulu, Hawaii 96814  \nEmail: patmor@aol.com  \nCell: (703) 405 -0925  \n \n  \n \n February 21,2022\nKarlRhoads, Chair\nSenateCommittee ontheJudiciary\nStateCapital\nRoom204\nHonolulu, HI96813\nDearChairman Rhoades:\nIamhonored tobeconsidered foraposition ontheStatewide Voters\nwithSpecialNeedsAdvisory Committee.

Please describe why you believe that you are qualified to be a member of the Committee. Please discuss any skills, expertise, knowledge, or volunteer \ninvolvement that would aid in your decision-making ability. See answer to #3.  \n5. What do you hope to accomplish during your term as a member of the Committee? If I have one of the three-year terms, I would, working with other \nCommittee members, develop questionnaires and conduct focus groups with the target \npopulations throughout the state to learn in detail what their participation in the voting \nprocess has been, what changes they seek, and then work with the Board of Elections \nto implement needed recommendations.  This would include clear messaging to the \ntarget populations. The critical question that could be answered by such an approach \nwould be to determine to what extent in the past people in the target populations voted, \nand following implementation of needed changes, to what extent did participation \namong the target populations increase.  \n6. As this is a new Committee, what issues do you believe the Committee should address? The key is to document the extent to which people in the target population \nhave voted in the past and to consider their recommendations and suggestions on how \nto improve participation in the voting process in the future. One likely key suggestion \nwill be to ensure that someone in each of the voting centers is equipped to assist \npeople in the target populations in an appropriate manner. \n7. Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interests that could arise during your service on the Committee? How would you overcome any possible conflicts of \ninterest? No.  \n8. Is there any other information regarding your experience and background that you believe should be considered for your nomination? No, although the breadth \nand depth of my leadership abilities as well as my experience in organizing and \nworking in groups especially would be an asset to the Committee.  \n9. Is there anything in your background that might be deemed as negative or controversial by the Senate? No. \n10. Please provide a current copy of your resume, to be shared with Senate members \nand their staff.  It accompanies this letter. \nThank you. \nSincerely, \n Patricia A. Morrissey \n \nms"},

HDRC is \nHawaii\u2019s protection and advocacy system, serving persons with disabilities. Outreach and \neducation, advocacy, and voter registration are included among the services we provide.  \nI first met Mr. Gashel in 2020 at a virtual meeting arranged by the NFB of Hawaii to address \nvoting accessibility concerns of their members. The 2020 election was our state\u2019s first time \nimplementing the new vote by mail law passed in 2019. The Help America Vote Act makes clear \nthat voters with disabilities have the right t o cast a secret ballot and vote in private, but this is a \nchallenge when printed ballots are sent out to everyone by mail.  \nMr. Gashel has been a leader here in Hawaii in working to address accessibility issues like this. \nHis resume includes more than 33 ye ars in governmental relations leadership positions at the \nNational Federation of the Blind, and working to develop text to speech reading technology \nneeded by persons with print disabilities. His leadership includes advocacy in passing voter \nassistance pro visions added to the federal Voting Rights Act, Disability access provisions in the \nHelp America Vote Act, and work with many others to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act.  \nBased on what I know of Mr. Gashel and my observation of his work with the gro up during our \nvirtual meeting, I am confident that his work on the Statewide Voters with Special Needs \nAdvisory Committee will help to achieve important accessibility goals for persons with \ndisabilities in our state.

The Statewide Voters with \nSpecial Needs Advisory Committee is being established pursuant to section 2 of Act 213, passed \nand signed into law in 2021.   Important to this statute, you should know that all of the officers and \nvirtually all members of the National Federation of the Blind of Hawaii are blind.   \n \nJames Gashel is blind himself and especially well qualified for service on this new c ommittee in \nour state.   Beginning in January 1974, Mr. Gashel served for 33.5 years as director of government \nrelations for our parent organization, the National Federation of the Blind, in Washington, DC.   In \nthis position he became one of the best known and most effective advocates for blind people in \nthe United States.   His leadership includes successful advocacy for important provisions in the \nfederal Voting Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Help America Vote Act, \nclosely relating  to the special needs advisory committee's mission under Act 213.   \n \nBeginning in 2007, Mr. Gashel embarked on another 10 year career, working to develop and \npromote advanced reading technology for persons unable to read print due to blindness or other \ndisabilities.   As part of this effort he was instrumental in creating the world's first hand -held \nautomated reader used to convert printed text into speech and Braille.   \n \nNow retired, Mr. Gashel is the volunteer legislative chair of the National Federation of the Blind of \nHawaii.   In this capacity he recommended and wrote language which the legislature adapted for \nthe advisory committee and another provision in Act 213 relating to electronic authentication of \nspecial needs voters.   \n  \n National Federation of the Blind  of Hawaii  \nVirgil Stinnett, President NFBHI  | 2943 Kalakaua Avenue, Apt 304, Honolulu, HI 96815 | 808-722-4243  | www.hawaii.nfb.org  \n \n Speaking for our statewide organization, James Gashel is uniquely well qualified to serve on the \nStatewide Voters with Special Needs Advisory Committee. Knowing his dedication and ability to \nperform tasks expected, I am certain that Mr. Gashel will be an i mportant voice on behalf of \nspecial needs voters and bring great credit to our state.    \n \nMahalo for your consideration.  \n \n  \n \n Brandon G.

I am Brandon Young , \nsupporting James Gashel\u2019s appointment to the Statewide Voters with Special Needs Advisory \nCommittee . \n I have Known Mr. Gashel for a long time  now and I have every faith that he will do an \nexcellent as a part of the state -wide committee for Special Needs voters here in Hawaii. I first \nmet Mr. Gash el when I was an intern at the National Center for the Blind. Mr. Gashel has \nworked for  many years i n Washingto n defending the rights of the blind as the Director of \nGovernmen tal Affairs for the National Federation of the Blind. Mr. Gashel has a hand in many \nlandmark pieces of legislation dealing with the blind and people with disabilities in our country . \nMr. Gashel worked on the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Help America Vote Act and has \na strong knowledge of the Randolph Shepard program f or blind vendors. I know that Mr. Gashel \nis the right person for t his committee and I am submitting testimony in support of his \nnomination. I want to thank you and your committee for hearing the nomination of Mr. Gashel. I \nurge you to pass the nominatio n of Mr. Gashe l for the State -wide committee for Special Needs \nvoters.   Testimony of James Gashel  \nBefore the committee on Judiciary (JDC)  \nHAWAII STATE SENATE  \nThirty -first legislature, regular session of 2022  \nApril 6, 2022, 9:31 AM, hearing on GM592  \n \nGood morning Chair Rhoads, Vice Chair Keohokalole, and members. I am James \nGashel, nominated by Governor Ige in GM592 to the Statewide Voters with Special \nNeeds Advisory Committee.  \n \nThank you for this opportunity to appear and express my interest in servin g. This \nStatewide Voters with Special Needs Advisory Committee was created by section 2 of \nAct 213 passed last year. I am legislative chair of the National Federation of the Blind of \nHawaii and among the principal proponents of the legislation creating thi s committee.  \n \nI have been blind since the day I was born. I have voted in every general and mid -term \nelection from the year I reached age 21 to the present. I was 60 before the election \ntechnology allowed me to cast a completely private and independent ba llot. That was \npossible due to accessible election technology purchased and required in the Help \nAmerica Vote Act. I worked on that bill while serving as director of government relations \nat the National Federation of the Blind, a position I held for 33.5 y ears.  \n \nI moved to Hawaii when I retired and found right away that our brand new vote by mail \nsystem was lacking some needed accessibility features. The state\u2019s idea was that \nvoters with disabilities could go to voter service centers and use the accessible  \nmachines while voters without disabilities could vote with convenience and privacy at \nhome or in the office. That seemed inconsistent with the idea of equal rights and equal \nopportunity, particularly so when along came the pandemic during 2020.  \n \nWe need better solutions for special needs voters rather than just providing accessibility \nat voter service centers. This committee and the legislature helped us get on the path to \nbetter solutions with enactment of at least three important provisions in SB548 las t year, \nwhich became Act 213 when signed by the governor. The appointment of statewide and \ncounty special needs voters advisory committees is one of the solutions you helped to \nenact.  \n Working for the National Federation of the Blind I learned it is far b etter to be part of the \nsolution than to just be part of the problem looking on from the sidelines. With my \nexperience, having worked to pass the voters with disabilities assistance provisions in \nthe federal Voting Rights Act, the accessibility requirement s in the Help America Vote \nAct, working with many others to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act and related \nlaws, and working with the legislature on Act 213 last year, I believe I can help the make \nHawaii a national accessibility leader among the gro wing number of vote by mail states. \nThat\u2019s my motivation. I will be honored to serve voters with print disabilities and other \nvoters with special needs in our state.  \n \nMy resume and responses to questions I received from Chairman Rhoads have been \nsubmitted . Mahalo for the opportunity to submit this statement and respond to any other \nquestions you may have.  "},

I've  conducted trainings about the attitudes  about disabilities people have which \ncan be barriers or  contribute to success of people with disabilities in areas such as voting, transportation, employment, public places and moving through life. The more inclusive access is will result to assist the public to see people as independent rather than perhaps helpless.  \n  5.  What do you hope to accomplish during your term as a member of the Committee?  \n I  hope that the committee can pick one or  two projects that are completed, marketed as accessible, \nmeet the needs of people with and without  disabilities and the projects may be completed and not just talked about.  Results make a difference.  \n \n6. As this is a new Committee, what issues do you believe the Committee should address?  \nAnswer: Since access law has been around for quite some time the committee should  be able to  really \nmake a difference.

Karl Rhoads and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:  \nI fully support and encourage the appointment of Kathryn Keim to the Statewide Voters With \nSpecial Needs Advisory Committee.  \nI have known Katie since 2006, when my husband and I decid ed that living full -time in \nsometimes frigid Chicago was too much \u2014 and we bought an apartment at Tropic Seas, the coop \nbuilding where Katie and her husband live.  \nMy first real encounter with her was in that town square of apartment life, the laundry \nroom.   Our main topic of conversation that day was geography, and Katie wanted her memory to \nbe refreshed as to how, in the state of Michigan, one could travel south and reach Canada.  \nKatie\u2019s curiosity and desire to know how things work and fit together complem ent her \nphotographic memory.   During her very successful tenure as president of the coop board, she \nkept figures, names and dates in her mind - while most of the rest of us scrambled for notes and \npapers.   In my 16 years at Tropic Seas, I have never known a board president who was as sharp \nas Katie, or as adept at juggling egos and politics of palace intrigue.  \nBefore I knew Katie well, I watched her and knew she was someone I\u2019d like to get to know.   She \nand Virgil would host gatherings for their friends and  for business associates - both blind and \nsighted.   Some were newly blind - just beginning to deal with the world that Katie was forced to \nconquer decades ago.     \nI\u2019ve always admired Katie\u2019s ease of entertaining and welcome - true aloha.   She is a great co ok - \nbanana bread, cakes, pesto - and she loves to cook for others, fortunately.   She has a green \nthumb.   She has managed to grow a lime on her sunlight -challenged lanai, where she has \nproduced basil, potatoes - and has high hopes for a Meyer lemon blossom  turning into a lemon.  \nKatie\u2019s interest in the world around her is amazing to me.   When Katie and Virgil visited us in \nChicago, we went on the architecture river cruise.   As other tourists were talking and taking \nphotos, Katie was listening to the docent\u2019s every word - taking it all in and asking questions \nafterward.  Because of her background in fashion design, she always is interested in what people are \nwearing.   She will feel the texture of my shirt and if it\u2019s not one of my usual hole -riddled polos, \nshe\u2019ll compliment me when I\u2019m sporting something that\u2019s, usually, outside my comfort zone.  \nKatie has a wicked sense of humor.   A good storyteller - one whose tales are based o n fact not \nhyperbole.   But she\u2019s also a good listener, the first to comfort me when our cat died a few weeks \nago. \nI have only a few friends who - by meeting them - changed my life for the better.   Katie is one of \nthose rare friends: life -affirming, loving and very dear.   People throw around the word \n\u201cinspiration\u201d quite a bit, but it fits Katie like a glove.  \nStephen Miller  \n  \n GM-595 \nSubmitted on: 3/13/2022 10:52:30 AM  \nTestimony for JDC on 3/15/2022 9:30:00 AM  \nSubmitted By  Organization  Testifier Position  Testify  \nNorman Miller  Individual  Support  Written Testimony \nOnly  \n \n \nComments:  \nRe: GM 595 Kathryn Keim JDC Confirmation Hearing - 3/15/2022  \nDear Senate Judiciary Committee Members,  \nMy name is Norman Miller and I am writing in whole -hearted support of my friend, Katie \nKeim\u2019s nomination to the Statewide Voters with Special Needs Adviso ry Committee.  \nI am a retired administrator, formerly with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and I have \nknown Katie for almost 16 years since we both have apartments in the same building. Katie has \nimpressed me from the start of our friendship  with her intelligence, wit, and communication \nskills. She has an amazing ability to warmly connect with others. She listens, researches, \nresponds, retains, and remembers. I have observed that she is equally skilled meeting new people \non the street as leading a committee meeting via zoom.  \nKatie currently serves as a board member of our building co -operative and has also been the \nchair for several years. Our co -op, like most, is a diverse group with wide -ranging views and \nopinions. I agree with many of my fellow  apartment owners that Katie\u2019s contribution is a great \nasset to our management. In leadership she gets things done with willing hard work, \nconsultation, delegation, negotiation, and fairness.  \nOn a more personal level, I am constantly in awe of Katie\u2019s abil ity not only to navigate daily a \nworld that is set -up predominately for sighted persons, but more than that, to power forward in it, \nand to be a force for the blind community, promoting their skills, talents, and contributions, \nwhile always advocating for their needs. She has a wide network of colleagues and ohana who \nrespect and love her.  \nKatie would be a vital and hard -working contributor to the advisory committee bringing \nextremely valuable  life and work  experience. In these times when minority voting ac cess is \nunder serious threat, Hawaii and the rest of the US needs to hear more strong voices like Katie\u2019s \nto ensure we all have an equal say in our leaders and lives.  \nPlease confirm her appointment to the committee.  \n Curtis Chong  \n14152 East Linvale Place, Unit 201  \nAurora, Colorado 80014  \nEmail: chong.curtis@gmail.com  \n \nMarch 13, 2022  \n \nTo whom it may concern:  \n \nI submit this letter in support of Kathryn Keim to serve on the \nStatewide Voters With Special Needs Advisory Committee . She is more \nthan capable of advocating in support of the interests of voters in \nHawaii who are blind, visually impaired, and/or print -disabled.  \n \nMs. Keim, who is herself blind, has herself traveled the long road from \nbeing a person with  fully normal vision to someone who, in spite of \nblindness, lives an active and productive life.  Ms. Keim  has decades of \nexperience working as an advocate for blind and visually impaired \npeople in Hawaii. In addition, Ms. Keim has herself served as a \nprofe ssional in the field of work with the blind and has been a key \nplayer in helping Hawaii\u2019s agency for the blind, Ho\u2019opono, to transition \nits programs from a service delivery system with an archaic and \nrepressive notion of blindness to a powerful service del ivery system \nwhich recognizes the competence and innate normality of blind \npeople.  \n \nI myself am a blind person who, for more than twenty years, grew up in \nthe state of Hawaii back in the 1960\u2019s. Back then, programs for the \nblind in Hawaii were not as they are today.  Back then, I and my blind \nfriends were more likely to have to sit through group therapy sessions \nwith a sighted psychologist instead of participating in sessions led and \nskillfully moderated by successful and active blind adults who can \nserve as role models encouraging younger children and teenagers to \naspire to do great things  with their lives . \n As a nonvisual access technology consultant who helps blind people, \nyoung and old, to master the technologies we must use to get online, I \nwill say with out equivocation that Ms. Keim understands both the \npowerful abilities which technology can offer to those of who are blind \nas well as its more vexing and frustrating challenges.  This, combined \nwith her personal knowledge of how the blind conduct the neces sary \nactivities of life (among them, voting) makes Kathryn Keim a \ntremendously wonderful candidate for the Statewide Voters With \nSpecial Needs Advisory Committee . \n \nYours sincerely,  \n \nCurtis Chong  \n \nMarch 13, 2022  \n \nPeggy Chong  \n14152 E. Linvale Pl, 201  \nAurora Colorado, 80014  \nchongpeggy10@gmail.com  \n \n \nTo whom it may concern:  \n \nI am pleased to write in support of Kathryn Keim to serve on the Statewide Voters With \nSpecial Needs Advisory Committee  for the state of Hawaii .  \n \nMs. Keim has always taken a keen interest in the affairs of the blind, not just in Hawaii, \nbut across the nation . Her outgoing personality, easily befriends individuals from all walks \nof life.  Being a blind person and diabetic  she embraces  life to its fullest and personally \nencourages others to do the same.  \n \nShe serves as an example to everyone she touches . Willing to try anything , she \ndemonstrates to others how a problem becomes a tr iumph . Through her participation in her \ncommunity, Ms. Keim learns much from others, building on her knowledge and joyfully \nconquers  the next community needs with joy .  \n \nWhen involved in issues of importance to her, Ms. Keim diligently seeks out stakeholde rs \nfrom all points of view to ensure the decisions she makes can provide quality, maximum \nresults for all concerned .  \n \nI believe Ms. Keim will be an asset to the committee and to the state of Hawaii.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nPeggy Chong  \nW@/;,LU\u201c\"\u20183Testimony in favor of Kathryn Keim to be a member of the  Statewide Voters With \nSpecial Needs Advisory Committee  \n \nPresented by David Eveland, former administrator of Hawai'i DVR - Blind Services, \nHo`opono  \n \nDear legislators:  \n \nI have worked alongside Katie Keim for over 20 years. She helped our agency deal \nsuccessfully with many technical issues including those involving computer \nequipment and Braille communication, as well as how to conduct effective \noutreach to potential consumers of Ho`opo no\u2019s programs and services. Thanks to \nher efforts we were one of the few organizations across the country to be \nrecognized as a program of excellence by the National Blindness Rehabilitation \nCertification board. I am confident that Katie will be a great as set as a committee \nmember and that she will work diligently to ensure that all people will be able to \ncast their votes.  \n \nDave Eveland  \n3/11/2022  \n \n Susan Rockwood Gashel      Tele: 808 -430-3290  \nAttorney at Law        Fax: 720 -437-8265  \n2801 Coconut Ave., #6G            susangashel@gmail.com                                      \nHonolulu, HI  96815   \n \nMarch 14, 2022  \n \nCommittee on Judiciary  \nHawaii State Senate  \nMarch 15, 2022 9:30 a.m.  \nHearing on GM595  \n \nDear Chair Rhodes and Members of the Committee:   \n \nI have known Katie Keim both professionally and personally since approximately 2005.

When I first met Katie her position was consulting and \ninstruction in assistive technology for the Department of Education.   \n \nShe has always been generous with her time to assist others to understand complex \nregulations and policies.  Katie has spent much time mentoring the newly blind and blind \nyouth, and serves as a positive role model to all.  She is truly an exa mple of how an \nindividual with a disability can overcome the barriers placed in her way, not only by her \ndisability, but by the attitudes of individuals who hold false beliefs about the abilities of the \ndisabled.  \n \nKatie has worked hard as liaison to consum er groups in her past positions, and is perceived \nas fair and attentive to the needs of all stakeholders.  Formerly employed by the State of \nHawaii\u2019s Division of the Vocational Rehabilitation Services, she was charged with drafting \nthe state plan for a num ber of years.  I have known Katie to be always willing to step in to \ntake on duties to ensure that staff shortages did not prevent her from per forming not only all \nof the functions that were assigned to her, but other duties as well, to ensure the smooth \nfunctioning of the office.   \n \nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions concerning Katie Keim or \nher qualifications for the position.   \n \n       Sincerely,  \n       \n       Susan Rockwood Gashel  \n \n \nKathryn Keim  Response to Senate JUDICIARY COMMITTEE  \nFebruary 20, 2022  \n \n1.

(\u201c Ms. Shikada\u201d) to be confirmed and retained as Attorney General for the \nState of Hawai\u2018i . Ms. Shikada has  the requisite intelligence, skills, training, and experience to \nserve our community as the Attorney G eneral.  \n I have known Ms. Shikada for 40 years. We are classmates from the William S. \nRichardson, Hawai\u2018i  School of Law. We have maintained both a personal friendship and \nprofessional relationship throughout all of those years. It has been my h onor and privi lege to \nhave these relati onships with her. Until the pandemic, we gathered 3- 4 times a year socially \nalong with other classmates.  \n Professionally, when Ms. Shikada was in pr ivate practice , we had cases that we \nworked on along with, and against one another. For many years before Ms. Shikada became the acting Attorney General, when she was the Deputy Attorney General that had responsibility for the Department of Educati on (\u201c DOE \u201d), we had to communicate and work together several times \na year. I have represented th e Oahu Interscholastic Associati on (\u201c OIA\u201d) for approximately 15 \nyears. In that capacity, I worked with Ms . Shikada on legislative issues and lawsuits  that were \nfiled against the DOE and OIA.  \n \n  Based upon 40 years of observation and experience, I recommend that Ms. Shikada be confirmed as the Attorney General.  \n        Very truly yours,           Lyle S.

I am Daniel Hanagami, \nthe Chief Special Investigator for the Investigations Division  of Department of the Attorney General.  I am \nsubmitting this testimony in my personal capacity and on my own time.   \nI have held my  position as Chief Special Investigator for over eight years.   Prior to that, I served in the \nHonolulu Police Department for 27.5 years and 8 years as a private investigator.  Retiring as a M ajor in \nthe Honolulu Police Department , I have investigated the majority of the complex financial fraud and \ngovernment corruption cases in Honolulu.  I had a stellar, accomplished,  decorated , and unblemished \ncareer in serving our  community.   I take pride in upholding and maintaining the integrity of the \nInvestigation s Division and the Department as a whole.  Because of my belief in fairness, integrity,  and \nhonesty, I am compelled to strongly oppose the nomination of Ms. Holly Shikada for the position of \nAttorney General.  \nCurrently, I am a subordinate to A ttorney General Holly Shikada,  and she is my supervisor.   She was also \nmy designated supervisor when she was the First Deputy Attorney General, since the prior Attorney \nGeneral had to recuse h erself from supervising me due to the civil rights violation she committed  against \nme.  \nI am strongly opposing the confirmation of Holly Shikada as  the Attorney General for the State of Hawaii \nbased upon  my interactions with her.  I personally observed that she  lacks the following essential \nqualities  in being the  Attorney General  for the State of Hawaii:   integrity; honesty;  legal  ability ; \nleadership  and managerial skills; common  sense ; communication skills;  problem solving abilities ; ability \nto be fair;  and she is not ethically sound to uphold th is esteem ed position  as the top law enforcement \nofficer and legal counsel for the State of Hawaii .  \nAttorney General Shikada has participated and schemed , with the prior A ttorney General and her staff,  \nto violat e my civil rights , utilizing fraud to discriminate against me .  I addressed my complaint to a \nfederal agency last year and that agency has determined that  their fraudulent conduct s warranted the \nDepartment of the Attorney General to be charged with a civil rights violation.  The charge is currently \nbeing investigated by that federal agency.  What the Office of the Attorney General did to me was \nsimilar to  what the Kealoha s did to their uncle .  In my situation, the  Office of the Attorney General  filed \nfalse reports against me and sent it to the Department of Public Safety for investigation  (as of this date, \nafter about  eleven months  of their re quested investigation  to PSD , I have not been contacted by any \ninvestigator to be interviewed , nor has the Human Resources Division informed  me of the status of \nthese false charges after I made inquiry  with the admin istrator ). \nAs part of her fraudulent conduct with others in the Office of the Attorney General, to include her \nSpecial Assistant  Gary Yamashiroya, Attorney General Shikada failed to allow me  proper  due process  \nunder the civil service laws in the Hawaii Revised Statutes .  In matters of fabricating false reports , she \nwas instrumental in creating a hostile  work environment to harass me , with the intent of having me \nresign, even when the documentary evidence of their false charges clearly exhibited that I was not \nconducting any administrative violation s nor jeopardizing a n investigation.   This type of conduct is not \nwithin the character o f an ethical and honest Attorney General, who should always assess facts before \ncoming to conclusion s.  STRONG OPPOSITION IN HOLLY SHIKADA BEING CONFIRMED AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF \nHAWAII -GM596 \nAttorney General Shikada participated in initiating a fraudulent report of my arrest of a violent homeless \nindividual that assaulted me on S tate property .  Even after I convicted the suspect with the Honolulu \nProsecutor \u2019s Office  (who found no wrongdoing in my investigative report , nor my conduct during the \narrest ) Attorney General Shikada participated in accusing me of improper use of my pepper spray in my \nself- defense and the illegal use of blue lights mounted in an approved State of Hawaii vehicle in the \nparking lot of a State of Hawaii building.  \nAttorney General Shikada also participated in filing another false report stating that I jeopardized and \ncompromis ed the safety of my Special Agents  by submitting a billing for services to another State agency  \nthat disclosed the identity of my Special Agents .  The documentary evidence clearly showed that I was \nnot involved  in the submittal of that billing and I committed  no w rongdoing.  Attorney General Shikada \nshould have been aware of this had she done  her due diligence to investigate this matter as an attorney .     \nThis is not an isolated incident , whereby , their vile actions were made only  against me.  Ms. Shikada\u2019s \nconduct  of participating in false allegations against employees is corroborated by a current lawsuit \nagainst the Department by a former Supervising Deputy Attorney General.  In that case, Attorney \nGeneral Shikada participated in establish ing a hostile work environment  and utilizing fraudulent conduct \nto force that  Supervis ing Deputy Attorney General into constructively dis missing  herself from the \nDepartment of the Attorney General .  This lawsuit is public record s, and the evidence  of that civ il suit \nidentifies  the fraudulent employment practices  of the Office of the Attorney General against that \nSupervi sing Deputy Attorney General.  \nAttorney General Shikada attempts to weaponize the legislative process  by retaliating against me in \norder to take away my  law enforcement powers because she cannot do it legally  with just cause .  She \nschemed with others in her Office of the Attorney General to submit a bill to take away the civil service \nstatus of my position  and that of the Administrator of the Hawaii Criminal Justice Data Center  with no \nvalid  or logical  justification s.  It appears Ms. Shikada and her Office of the Attorney G eneral want to sail \ninto unchartered waters by executing employment actions contrary to what competent government \nmanage rs would do.  A responsible manager would never change civil service positions into exempt \npositions , which is an unlikely action done in Hawaii government  with a union atmosphere.  \n Attorney General Shikada also planned  to disassemble  my Investigations Division by participating with \nthe Department of Public Safety to send my Special Agents  to the D epartment  of Law Enforcement  with \nno competent reorganizational plans , coordination, and logistics .  These deficiencies  of a failed \nreorganizational plan  would render my team  ineffective  in serving this community  as Special Agents  that \naddress complex financial crimes  and government corruption.  \nAttorney General Shikada also s chemed , without collaboration  with me , to remove  approximately  half \nof my Special Agents and transfer them to her Criminal Justice Division ; even though  these special \nagents  objected  in being sent to that  division .  She did this in retaliation  against  me to reduce my \nsupervisory capability.  This lack of collaboration violate d the spirit of her own office policy , which \nencourages  all employees to work collaboratively .  She never discussed the se changes  with me, her  \nChief Special Investigator.  This behavior, by restricting her  Chief Special Investigator from participation, \nis contrary to and violates the spirit of Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a789 -1 Statement of findings and policy, \nwhere public employees have been granted the right to s hare in the decision -making process affecting \nwages and working conditions, when this is done, they have become more responsive and better able to \nexchange ideas and information on operations with their administrators.     STRONG OPPOSITION IN HOLLY SHIKADA BEING CONFIRMED AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF \nHAWAII -GM596 \n \nAttorney General Shikada has made admi ssions  to me that she has little  knowledge of what law \nenforcement does in the State of Hawaii and she must  rely upon her S pecial Assistant  to the A ttorney \nGeneral as a resource .  Her Special Assistant serves as her enhance ment to vile and retaliatory actions  \nagainst me and my Investigations Division  with both  resorting to skullduggery behaviors.  \nRecently, the public was made aware of corruption within our community.  Confirming Ms. Shikada as \nthe Attorn ey General, without scrutinizing her conduct  and skills , will undermine the integrity of the \nDepartment  and will severely jeopardize public safety and enhance further distrust in government.  \nShould there be any doubt as to what I have testified, I would invite this legislative body to conduct your  \nown investigation with your subpoena powers.  \nThank you for allowing me to testify.  \n Dale A. Head 1637 Ala Mahina Place   Honolulu, Hawaii 96819 [ sunnymakaha@yahoo.com ]   (808) 228-8508 TO:   Senate Committee on Judiciary - Chair Karl Rhoads, Vice Chair Jarrett Keohokaole,            Laura Acasio, Mike Gabbard, Donna Mercado Kim, Chris Lee, and, Kurt Fevella        Subject: Governor\u2019s Message (GM) 596 Nomination of Holly T. Shikada as Hawaii Attorney General 1.  While Acting Attorney General Holly T. Shikada has a great resume and oversees a sta\ufb00 of 650+ people, respectfully I ask the Senate to not con\ufb01rm this nomination.  As noted in this \u201cOverview\u201d piece from our Hawaii Attorney General website, the position is designated as the \u201cchief law enforcement o\ufb03cer of the State of Hawaii\u201d.  Surely that should also mean enforcing decisions handed down by the Hawaii Supreme Court, in my humble opinion. [ From the Attorney General website ]          OVERVIEWMission Statement:\u00a0 To provide excellent legal and public services in a timely manner.Roles and Responsibilities.\u00a0 The Attorney General is the chief legal of\ufb01cer and chief law enforcement of\ufb01cer of the State of Hawaii.\u00a0 The Attorney General is appointed by the Governor. 180 attorneys and over 500 professional and support personnel assist the Attorney General in ful\ufb01lling the responsibilities of the of\ufb01ce.2.  In the role of \u201cChief law enforcement of\ufb01cer of the State of Hawaii\u201d, that should include enforcement of Hawaii Supreme Court decisions affecting our Legislature.  More speci\ufb01cally, on 4 November of 2021 the Court ruled the practice of \u2018Gut and Replace\u2019 schemes practiced by law makers at an end.  While amendments still can be made to Bills, they must be \u201cgermane\u201d.3.  On 16 February 2022, during a public Hearing on SB2852 the Committee Chair gutted the Voting Rights Bill for taxpayers who own properties in Home Owners Associations.  None of the sitting Committee Members dared to question her action, instead rubber stamping approval, without comment.4.  Due to public media accounts of the Hawaii Supreme Court decision, to include news stories and comments by some Legislators, I decided to ask our State Attorney General to enforce the \u2018Decision\u2019.  First I called the AG Of\ufb01ce on Friday 25 February 2022, and after discussion with a staffer, decided to make it a formal email letter.  Sent the email message out two days later on 27 February 2022.  After not getting a timely reply, not even an acknowledgement, phoned that Of\ufb01ce again on Wednesday 2 March 2022.  A different staffer promised to check on the request.  Never heard from her again.5.  I am embedding the 27 February 2022 email letter below.  The statement about being the State Chief Law Enforcement Of\ufb01cer apparently does not include our State Supreme Court.  And, there is no \u2018timely\u2019 response being made.  So, this means Legislators are again free to \u2018Gut and Replace\u2019 any Bills they wish to.  This really makes lobbyist happy.6.  The Senate had declined to con\ufb01rm a previous appointment, that of Judge Dan Gluck.  You should do the same with this one, in my opinion.Respectfully,  Dale A. HeadSunday 27 March 2022\u2022From:\u00a0Dale Head <sunnymakaha@yahoo.com>\n\u2022Date:\u00a0February 27, 2022 at 8:14:28 PM HST\n\u2022To:\u00a0\"Attorney General Holly T. Shikada\" <atg.legcoordinator@hawaii.gov>\n\u2022Subject:\u00a0Legislator non-compliance with Hawaii Supreme Court ban on \u2018Gut & Replace\u2019\n\u2022\u2028Sunday February 27, 2022\n\u2022\u2028Aloha:\n\u2022\u20281. \u00a0I am writing today regarding non-compliance with the Hawaii Supreme Court (HSC) decision (issued 4 November 2021) which prohibited \u2018Gut and Replace\u2019 schemes in our Legislature \u00a0- \u00a0Speci\ufb01cally by\u00a0Senator Rosalyn Hestor Baker\u00a0in her capacity as Chair of the Hawaii Senate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection (CPN). \u00a0And, also, misuse of this same HSC decision by Representative Aaron Ling Johanson in his capacity as Chair of House Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPC). Particulars are as follows -\u2028\u20222a. \u00a0Maui state Senator Rosalyn Hestor Baker,\u00a0after taking testimony during a video recorded Hearing of\u00a0SB2852,\u00a0which accorded the right for members of Home Owners Associations to cast their vote(s) by US Mail, over the Internet, or by other electronic means (meaning telephonic to a neutral 3rd party business that specializes in conducting elections),\u00a0amended\u00a0the Bill passing such a decision on to the Board of Directors of an HOA (of which there are now about 1,800 in Hawaii (a \ufb01gure that \ufb02uctuates from year to year). \u00a0With the amendment in place this preserves status quo ante wherein about\u00a070% of HOA members, being investors and not owner occupants of their properties, are\u00a0blocked\u00a0from casting their own vote. [Note - Back in 2005 the Legislature promulgated Hawaii Revised Statute\u00a0514b-123\u00a0which speci\ufb01ed an Association member must be \u2018present in person\u2019 at an election meeting in order to cast their own vote. \u00a0This action screened out a majority of owners as they are investors. \u00a0It also blocked frail elderly and disabled owner-occupants who are mobility challenged from exercising their \u2018right to vote\u2019 as they too cannot attend a meeting. Presently there are about\u00a0173,000\u00a0condominiums in Hawaii, with\u00a070%\u00a0of owners being investors, this means over\u00a0121,000\u00a0owners are denied the right to vote (in an HOA election.] \u00a0\u2028\u20222b. \u00a0As the Hearing was recorded and posted on YouTube, it can be viewed at this link:\u2028\t\t \thttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P34t0BGSkZE\u2028\u20222c. \u00a0While viewing the above link, simply pull your cursor on that video screen to timestamp\u00a045.28\u00a0(meaning 45 minutes and 28 second mark), to view when Senator Baker amended SB2852 thereby perpetrating a Gut and Replace maneuver which is then titled as\u00a0SB2852 SD1. \u00a0I o\ufb00er my own comments, earlier, about the right to vote being suppressed at time mark\u00a014.58, that over many many years people have died to win the right to vote.\u2028\u2022\u20282d. \u00a0While the Committee supposedly passed as\u00a0SB2852 SD1, pushing o\ufb00 onto HOA Board of Directors to decide the question, should they do so this would put them in con\ufb02ict with existing HRS514b-123. \u00a0And, lawyers would advise them they cannot ignore \u2018state law\u2019. \u00a0Consider, the Legislature in 2005 truncated Voting Rights in HOAs, which was injurious to most members, and now Senator Baker ducks Legislative accountability by pointing a \ufb01nger at HOA Boards to deal with Voting Rights. \u00a0This clearly was a Gut & Replace maneuver, introducing a\u00a0non-germane\u00a0portion\u00a0which Committee members were okay with. None of them objected.\u2028\u20222e. \u00a0Senator Baker, out of public view, accepts donations from business lobby groups, and their O\ufb03cers, then does their bidding by killing Bills they object to, in my opinion. \u00a0\u2028She refused to schedule a Voting Rights related HOA speci\ufb01c Bill,\u00a0SB724\u00a0introduced by Senator Maile Shimabukuro, at my request, in\u00a02019, then again the Senator blocked the same issue in\u00a02021\u00a0when it was introduced by Senator Lorraine Inouye of the the \u2018Big Island\u2019 (Hawaii). \u00a0The \u2018Public Good\u2019 is not being accomplished when this happens. \u00a0A useful Internet link to have a look at in this particular situation is:\n\u2022\u2028\t\thttps://www.followthemoney.org/entity-details?eid=4105485\u2028\u2022One of her donors is President of Hawaii Council of Community Organizations (HCCA), which in fact is a business lobby group. \u00a0Routinely both HCCA and CAI (Community Associations Institute), another business group with a misleading name, oppose any measures relating to voting rights, like,\u00a0HB347\u00a0&\u00a0SB724\u00a0in 2019.\u2028\u20282f. \u00a0Senator Baker in her \u2018report\u2019 regarding\u00a0SB2852 SD1\u00a0conjures up imaginary problems that would manifest if HOAs were required to allow members to vote, Ignoring that her decision for Boards of Directors, many of which are in fact \u2018puppet Boards\u2019 due to willful election maladministration by management companies, cannot approve a policy at variance with existing state condo law. \u00a0Senate President Ronald Kouchi could show leadership and intervene, as a matter of decorum, but will never do so.\u2028\u20283a. \u00a0Regarding\u00a0Representative Aaron Ling Johanson, Chair of the Hawaii House Committee on Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPC). \u00a0He convened a Hearing on Thursday February 3, 2022, for\u00a0HB1583\u00a0(which was the companion to\u00a0SB2852), giving to HOA members who cannot attend an election meeting in person, to exercise their vote(s) via US Mail, the Internet, or other electronic means. \u00a0This Hearing too was recorded on video then posted on the Internet, at, this link:\u2028\u2022https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xleRxG2sI6A\u2028\u20223b. \u00a0While reading submitted testimony is interesting, and, watching the video, it was the manner in which Representative Johanson ducked having his Committee members decide whether or not HOA owners, taxpayers, can exercise voting rights, by citing the Supreme Court decision regarding \u2018Gut and Replace. \u00a0Watch and listen as he makes, at time mark\u00a01:50:28\u00a0(for 1 hour, 50 minutes, and 28 seconds), a rambling excuse for deferring his Committee from voting on HOA members rights in elections, curiously, blaming the Supreme Court prohibition on \u2018Gut & Replace\u2019. \u00a0Odd that Johanson has now \u2018weaponized\u2019 that Hawaii Supreme Court decision.\n\u2022\u20284. \u00a0We have an intractable corruption problem in our Legislature, as evidenced by several cases reported in news media recently. \u00a0This one of predatory business practiced aimed at HOAs via manipulation of elections, which they administer, has been going on for decades. \u00a0Respectfully I suggest the state Attorney General address this matter with the Governor, Legislative \u2018Leadership\u2019, the Legislators involved, and enforce the Supreme Court decision. \u00a0A public announcement to that e\ufb00ect would go towards restoring some modicum of public con\ufb01dence in our \u2018Law Makers\u2019\u2028\u2028Respectfully,\u00a0\u00a0Dale Arthur Head\u2028(808) 228-8508 Cell/Text \u00a0 \u00a0 (808) 836-1016 Home\u2028\t 1637 Ala Mahina Place \u00a0Honolulu, HI 96719\u2028\u2028Excerpt from Supreme Court Decision :\u00a0\u2028\u2028IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI\u02bbI\t \t \u00a0---o0o---\u2028\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF HONOLULU and COMMON CAUSE,\u2028\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Plainti\ufb00s-Appellants, vs. STATE OF HAWAI\u02bbI, Defendant-Appellee.\u2028\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t \t \t \t SCAP-19-0000372\u2028\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\t \t \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0CERTIORARI TO THE INTERMEDIATE COURT OF APPEALS\u2028\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (CAAP-19-0000372;

Shikada as the Attorney General for the State of Hawai \u02bbi.  I have been a \ndeputy attorney general for nearly 34 years. \nI have known Holly since she started working with the Family Law Division of the \nDepartment of the Attorney General (Department) in 1989.  Within a few short years she \nspearheaded a project to help the Department of Human Services address its heavily \nbacklogged adoption caseload and accelerate adoptions for children languishing in long \nterm foster care. \nHolly moved on to supervise the Education Division of the Department where she \nworked tirelessly to ensure that the Department of Education (DOE) was offering a Free \nAppropriate Public Education to all children in the State.  That was during the time that \nthe DOE and other State agencies had to work hard to ensure that the requirements of \nthe Felilx Consent Decree were met. \nWhen I was in the Health Division and Holly was still in the Education Division, \nshe took a leadership role in the reformation of Hawaii's public education system, which \nincluded the transition of Public Health Nurses into each school as School Health Aides. \nAs the current Supervising Deputy Attorney General for the Legislative Division \nof the Department, I have had the privilege and pleasure of working side-by-side with \nHolly on legislative matters when she became the First Deputy Attorney General in April The Honorable Karl Rhoads, Chair \nMarch 29, 2022 \nPage 2 \n \n2021, and when she assumed the role of Attorney General on December 10, 2021.  For \nas long as I have known Holly, she has never turned down an assignment, no matter \nhow difficult or challenging it has been. \nHolly's dedicated and dependable service to the State of Hawai \u02bbi as a long-\nstanding member of the Department of the Attorney General makes her best qualified to \nlead this Department.  She is widely respected within the Department for her work in all \ncapacities that she has served.  Because of her experience and knowledge from her \nvarious roles in the Department, she has taken on a myriad of difficult issues smoothly \nand diligently, and without hesitation from her first day as the Attorney General.  \nI urge the Committee to recommend her for confirmation.  Thank you for the \nopportunity to submit testimony in support of Holly.

Richardson School of Law in the Fall of 1982.   Ms. Shikada brings a wealth of \nlegal experience to the Department.   After working in private practice for the esteemed Wallace \nS.

Her oversight of the complex Felix case, \nleading to a Consent Decree, was probably a highlight of her career with the Depar tment.  \nHer legal knowledge, as well as her supervisory experience and leadership abilities will be of \nimmense benefit to the Department.   In all the time I have known her, I have never known Ms. \nShikada to be anything but a hard -working, tenacious, and ult imately fair, advocate, for whom \nintegrity is of the utmost importance..    \nMs. Shikada earned her undergraduate degree with a major in accounting from the Shidler \nCollege of Business and her Juris Doctor from the William S.

I initially \nworked with Holly when she was the supervisor of the Education division, and more recently, I \nhave had the privilege of working closely with Holly, as her Solicitor General, af ter she assumed \nthe roles of First Deputy Attorney General and now Attorney General.   I know Holly to be smart, \nincredibly hardworking, and fair.   She is also a genuinely kind and compassionate person, who \ncares deeply about the department and its employee s.  She is, moreover, a longtime deputy -- a \ntrue public servant with a vast wealth of institutional knowledge and deep commitment to the \nState and public service.  \nIn short, I know that Holly would continue to be a very fine and competent Attorney General -- a \nrole that she has been serving in since December of last year.

She is a dedicated leader who will  continue to elev ate the department and serve \nthe State with distinction.

Shikada as Hawaii Attorney General:  Testimony in    Strong Support         \n \n This testimony is submitted in STRONG SUPPORT of the nomination of Holly T. Shikada to be \nthe Attorney General of the State of Hawaii.  \n I have been honored to have worked closely with Ms. Shikada for  the past 10 years.  When I \ntransitioned from private practice to the Attorney General\u2019s of fice, Education Division, I was a \nfish out of water, not knowing much about education law and the  way that government \nfunctioned.  It was by working closely with Ms. Shikada that I was able to learn about education \nlaw.  She always had the time and willingness to sit down and d iscuss cases, the law, and \nstrategy.     During her time as the Supervising Deputy Attorney General of the Education Division, Ms. Shikada was well versed in many specialized areas of law, including civil litigation, appellate \npractice, family law, special educ ation law, contract and procurement review, and education law.  \nThat knowledge allowed our division to service and address most ly all of our education clients\u2019 \nneeds. She is someone who is not only a great leader, but someo ne who allows others the \nopportunity to become leaders themselves.  For instance, under her leadership, she developed \nthree current supervising deputy attorney generals, including m yself.  And, she is always a \nphone call away to provide me with guidance and leadership in my role as the supervisor of the Education Division.   Because of her leadership abilities and knowledge of the variou s areas of law, Ms. Shikada was \nelevated to First Deputy Attorney General approximately one yea r ago.  Her tireless work ethic -  \nover 12 hours a day in the office \u2013 allowed her to quickly pivot from serving her Education \nDivision clients, to serving the entire State of Hawaii.   \n Ms. Shikada also possesses the important character traits of in tegrity, honesty, and \ncompassion, which has served her well over the span of her lega l career.  Ms. Shikada has \nbeen dutifully and successfully serving as the interim Attorney  General for the past several \nmonths and there is no doubt that she is the best choice for th e position going forward.  Again, I \noffer my STRONG SUPPORT for her nomination and confirmation as the Attorney General of the State of Hawaii.    Sincerely,   \n \n Carter K.

Previously, she  led a unit within the department focused on ensuring compliance with a \nclass -action settlement known as the Felix Consent Decree.  Shikada also served in the \ndepartment\u2019s Family Law Division . \n  She started her legal career in private practice with the Fujiyama Duffy & Fujiyama law firm.   \nMs. Shikada is a graduate of the University of Hawaii\u2019s William S.

Shikada for the Attorney \nGeneral of the Department of the Attorney General  \n \n Chair Rhoads, Vice-Chair Keohoka lole, and members of the Judici ary Committee, \n Thank you for this opportunity to testify.  My name is Gary Yamashiroya and I am testifying in my personal and individual \ncapacity in full support of the nomination and confirmation of Holly T. Shikada for the \nposition of Attorney General f or the State of Hawai\u2018i. \n I am the current Special Assist ant to the Attorney General, app ointed by Attorney \nGeneral Connors in early April  2021 at the same time that the n ominee, Holly Shikada \nwas appointed as the First Deputy Attorney General.  Prior to my appointment as the Sp ecial Assistant, I knew AG Shi kada as the supervisor in \nthe Education Division, a neighbor  on the same floor in the Sta te Office Tower when I \nstarted working at the Department\u2019s Crime Prevention and Justic e Assistance Division \nabout 5 years ago.  My first impressions of her were that she w as very personable and \nprofessional, observations that w ere reinforced when I got to k now her better in my \ncurrent position.  It has been a year since our a ppointments, and I have additiona lly learned that AG \nShikada is a public servant in t he truest sense.  She is dedica ted to doing what\u2019s best for \nthe State and the Department\u2019s c lients, the Department of the A ttorney General, and most \nimportantly the people of the Sta te of Hawai\u2018i.  It is not a re sponsibility she t akes lightly, \nand she does not put herself above  or before her duties and she  expects the same of every \nemployee of the Department.  She  is also smart, conscientious, caring and always looking \nto do what is right over what is popular.     Her dedication is evidenced by her 30 years at the Department, serving in multiple \ncapacities all for the betterme nt of the State and its people, and I firmly believe she \nshould be able to continue to do so as the state Attorney Gener al. \n Thank you your consideration of my testimony in support of AG S hikada. \n  GM-596 \nSubmitted on: 3/28/2022 8:59:20 AM  \nTestimony for JDC on 3/29/2022 9:30:00 AM  \nSubmitted By  Organization  Testifier Position  Testify  \ntracie kahooilihala  Individual  Support  Written Testimony \nOnly  \n \n \nComments:  \nI urge the Judiciary Committee to confirm the appointment of Holly Shikada.   \n TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE NOMINATION OF  \nHOLLY SHIKADA  \nAS ATTORNEY GENERAL  FOR THE  STATE O F HAWAI 'I \n \n \nI support the nomination of Holly Shikada  as Attorney General . As a Deputy \nAttorney General and a Supervising Deputy Attorney General over the past 30 years, \nunder various  Attorney General administrations, Ms. Shikada has demonstrated her \nintelligence, know -how and dedication to public service .  Although I testify in my \nindividual capacity, I know f rom my experience as a fellow Deputy Attorney General for \nover 26 years, including 16 years as a Division Supervisor, that Ms. Shikada possesses  \nthe skills necessary  for success, making her an excellent candidate for the position of \nAttorney General for the State of Hawai'i.   \n \nThe Attorney General regularly addresses urgent, complex, novel, high profile \nand controversial issues.  I know that:  \n Ms. Shikada  does not shy away from difficult issues and difficult tasks.  She  is \nresponsive and fearless, calm under pressure and considered in her decisions.  \n \nMs. Shikada  possesses exceptional legal knowledge and skills  and draws from a \ndepth of experience.   She is practical , forthright, honest .  She cares about her work and \nattends to detail.  \n As a manager , Ms. Shikada is inclusive, supportive , firm and decisive. She knows \nthe job from the perspective of a frontline Deputy as well as a Division Supervisor, and \nnow as the State \u2019s Attorney General.  She is well respected by the rank and file of the \nDepart ment.   \n Ms. Shikada  is born and raised here and a proud product of Hawaii\u2019s public \nschool system (Go Cougars !).  She is a wife and a parent.  As a result, she knows Hawaii \nand its issues well, and appreciates and cares about how the citizens of the State can be \nimpacted by the actions of State government.  \n I support Ms. Shikada\u2019s nomination as the Attorney General for the State of \nHawai 'i.  For a variety of re asons, i t makes sense that the nominee, at this juncture of the \ncurrent administration, come from within.  But, in Ms. Shika da\u2019s nomination, the State \nfortuitously has a solid  candidate  under any circumstance -- a smart , capable attorney, \nwell prepared to address the many pressing legal matters confronting the State.  \n I urge this Committee\u2019s recommendation for the advice and consent of the Senate \nin relation to the nomination of Ms. Holly Shikada as the Attorney General for the State \nof Hawai 'i. She will undoubtedly continue her good work and serve us well.  \n \nThank you for this opportunity to submit testimony.  \n  \nDiane K.

I earned a Bachelors Degree \nin Accounting and was enrolled in the Masters of Accounting program when I was accepted to the \nWilliam S. Richardson School of L aw. \nAfter graduating from law school, I was fortunate enough to start my legal career at the esteemed law \nfirm of Fujiyama, Duffy & Fujiyama.  I worked at the firm for 4 years before deciding that I wanted to \nuse my law degree for public service work.  Thi s began my 30+ year career at the Department of the \nAttorney General.   \nIn 1989, I was hired as a Deputy Attorney General in the Family Law Division where I handled Child \nAbuse and Neglect cases.  These were some of the most difficult cases, not necessaril y because of their \ncomplexity, but mainly because of the difficulty in reading the reports and learning about the abuse our \nkeiki were suffering.  These cases were emotionally difficult, but I felt it was extremely important to do \nwhat I could to help thes e children who were being abused.  I worked with some of the most dedicated \npublic servants, the Department of Human Services social workers.  It was essential that we work as a \nteam to assist the families in creating a safe family home for these children or have the children adopted \nby a family who could provide them with a safe, stable, loving home.  While in the Family Law Division, \nI also handled a variety of other types of cases within the Family Court system, including Juvenile \nOffender cases, Guardia nship cases, and Adoption cases.  I appeared in Court on a daily basis, handled \nover a hundred trials, and had the pleasure of handling over a hundred adoption cases.  The adoption cases \nwere the only cases where we would be able to see the children and ex perience the excitement and '1059\nF\u00e9>\u2018\\.\u2018\u20ac\u00b0\u00a3..\u00a7'4q'\n\\a':i\\:.;';;-7v\u00a2_EX~\n5U2\u2018?T\u2018I\\=\\\n%\u2018<*~+\u00a7~*\">};}\u00e9\u00bb\\-\u00bb\\1'~'GM 596  \nPage 2 of 4 \n \n \nhappiness of the children and the families adopting them.  For years, the adoption calendar was extremely \nbacklogged and I had the good fortune of being able to work on a special project with then Senior Family \nCourt Judge Micha el Town to remodel the adoption system and clear the backlog.  We were able to work \ntogether to develop a more streamlined approach for adoption petitions and cleared the backlog within a \nfew years.   \nI worked in our Family Law Division for 10 years and in  1999, I was asked by then Attorney General Earl \nAnzai and First Deputy Attorney General Rick Keller to head the Felix Unit, which was created as a \nresult of the Felix Consent Decree litigation case.  The State\u2019s mission in that case was to ensure the \ndelivery of special education and related services to special needs students in Hawaii\u2019s public schools.  \nThis resulted in my transferring from the Family Law Division to the Education Division.  The deputies \nwho worked on the Felix case before me were instrum ental in working with the Department of Education \nand Department of Health to set up a system in which the two departments could work in concert to \naddress the special education and mental health services for our special needs students.  In 2005, as a \nresult of the hard work of the Department of Education and the Department of Health, the State was found \nto be in substantial compliance with the Consent Decree and the case was dismissed.  It was a team effort \nand I was proud to be a part of that team.  \nIn 200 3, then Attorney General Mark Bennett appointed me as the Supervisor of the Education Division.  \nIt was an extremely rewarding job and I enjoyed working closely with the Department of Education and \nall of our other Education Division clients, which include d the Board of Education, the Public Charter \nSchool Commission, the Public Charter Schools, the Hawaii State Public Library System, the Hawaii \nTeacher Standards Board, the Executive Office on Early Learning, and the Early Learning Board.  I \nserved as the E ducation Division supervisor for a total of 18 years; it was very rewarding work as public \neducation and providing opportunities for our keiki is extremely important to me.  My 2 children went \nthrough Hawaii\u2019s public education system and are productive wor king members of our community.  I \nthoroughly enjoyed working with the Education Division clients, assisting them in making a difference \nfor our children.   \nIn April 2021, I was asked by Attorney General Clare Connors if I would serve in the position of Fir st \nDeputy Attorney General as then First Deputy Dana Viola was selected to be the Corporation Counsel for \nthe City and County of Honolulu.  While I loved my job as supervisor of the Education Division, the \nposition of First Deputy Attorney General would gi ve me the opportunity to serve the State in a greater \ncapacity.  It would also provide me with the opportunity to continue learning and expanding my \nknowledge.  \nWhile I didn\u2019t officially start in the position as First Deputy Attorney General until April 202 1, I was \nprovided the opportunity to transition for approximately 1 month; the entire month of March was used to \ntransition from being the Education Division supervisor to the First Deputy Attorney General position.  \nThank you to Dana Viola for mentoring m e during that month.  From April until December, I had the \nbenefit of working as the First Deputy Attorney General under Clare Connors.  With the guidance and \nmentoring from Clare for those 9 months, along with 30+ years in the department, I am ready to ta ke on \nthe challenge of being the Attorney General.   \nWhile I was the Education Division supervisor, I was extremely fortunate to have worked with other \ndivision supervisors and a large number of other deputy attorneys general.  Since becoming the First \nDeputy Attorney General and now in this interim period as the Attorney General, I am privileged to work \nmore closely with a wider range of our supervisors and deputies.  I don\u2019t think words can do justice in GM 596  \nPage 3 of 4 \n \n \ndescribing the amazing talent and work of the depar tment\u2019s supervisors and deputies.  Their dedication to \ntheir job, their knowledge of their respective subject matter areas, and their desire to \u201cget it right\u201d in \nproviding the best legal advice to our clients is most impressive.  \nHaving the opportunity to l ead these individuals would be an incredible opportunity and no doubt the \nhighlight of my career.  \nIf allowed to lead this department, among my priorities are to work with the experts to continue to safely \nnavigate our State through this COVID pandemic; wor k on the mental health issues plaguing our \nhouseless population and communities; be more involved in addressing fraud and environmental crimes; \nand continuing to develop and provide employee training and the recruitment of quality attorneys.  \nOur department  has an excellent working relationship with the Department of Health and HIEMA and we \nwork with them on a daily basis to address the challenges created by this pandemic.  The curveballs \nthrown at us by this pandemic have been numerous and multifaceted.  Th e Deputies in our Department \nhave been able to manage the issues and litigation and have, to date, prevailed on every case relating to \nthe pandemic and the Governor\u2019s emergency proclamations.  \nI also know that much has been done with respect to identifying and working on the mental health issues \nplaguing our houseless population and communities.  Although there are no easy solutions to these issues, \nwe have a team of deputies working with various groups attempting to assist on addressing the myriad of \nissues .  This is an area that I would like our department to prioritize and continue working closely with \nthe experts on.  \nFraud and environmental crimes are other areas where violations seem to be on the rise.  Fraud, \nparticularly as it impacts some of our most vulnerable residents, the elderly and disadvantaged, is an area \nI\u2019d like to focus on.  We will continue to address and prosecute individual fraud cases; however, I would \nalso like our department to get aggressive in going after cases where there are indivi duals, groups of \nindividuals, or enterprises engaging in fraudulent schemes that are hurting our residents.   \nIllegal dumping, including hazardous waste materials, oil and petroleum spills, and water pollution are \nactivities significantly impacting our env ironment.  I would like to see our department become more \nactive in investigating these types of violations and bringing criminal charges when appropriate.  \nWe already have an established privacy law group that works on privacy issues, including how and whe n \nconfidential information can be shared and with whom.  Privacy issues are becoming more complex and \ncybercrimes are becoming more prevalent.  This is another area I would like our department to focus on.  \nIn order to appropriately address all of these dif ficult and involved issues, it is extremely important for \nour department to be able to continue recruiting and hiring the best and brightest attorneys.  We are \ncurrently working on a recruitment plan and have started a Summer Internship Program with the go al of \nspurring the interest of legal interns to consider public service law as a career choice.  It is my hope that \nthe legal interns will find public service and government law as interesting and rewarding as I have, and \nchoose to make this their career.  \nOur department has much to offer \u2013 we are the largest law firm in the State, we have lawyers with areas \nof expertise that do not exist elsewhere, and we have opportunities to experience novel legal issues that \nattorneys in private practice would never enco unter.  While hiring competent, hardworking attorneys is \nimportant, just as important is ensuring that these attorneys receive the training they need to be great GM 596  \nPage 4 of 4 \n \n \npracticing governmental law attorneys.  We have a very active committee that works on developi ng and \nproviding training for our deputies and staff.   \nIt is an exciting time to work for the State and for our department.

He has served in the legislative and executive branches of the city, state,  and federal levels of government.  He has also \nworked in the private sector representing workers and management. He has been a Congress ional Chief of Staff, an industry association president, and a federal officer. He \ncame to Hawaii in 1977 to attend Chaminade University where he earned a political science degree in 1981.   \n Patrick is particularly well qualified and an ideal selection  to not only keep DOT moving,  \nbut moving in the right direction.  I have had the honor of building a strong partnership \nwith him and continue to appreciate his thoughtful and diligent analysis of  our programs, \nbudgetary matters, and personnel issues. I have always found him fair , forthright , and \nflexible. He knows that making progress requires partnerships. In every instance, he \nhas exemplified competence, courtesy,  and professionalism.  \n In the short period of time that Patrick has been at DOT , I ha ve observed his ability to \nwork collaboratively to identify and resolve complex issues, all the while keeping in mind service to the public. Most of the staff who had the opportunity to work with him see him as a listener and quick learner who tempers his search for solutions with his knowledge, insight and commitment to balance. He has common sense and a commitment to getting the job done right. His wide range of experiences gives him a level of expertise and insight DOT will surely benefit from.  \n Having known and worked with Patrick over the years , I can attest that he is a man of \nexceptional character and integrity. His congenial personality makes it a pleasure to work with him. His honesty and sincerity mak e it easy for him to cultivate positive \n \n \nrelationships with everyone.

These \ninitiatives have been successfully completed in ways that support the mission of  the Navy and \nState of Hawaii, benefiting the social and economic well -being of Hawaii\u2019s citizens.  If approved \nas the Deputy Director of Transportation , his experiences and knowledge will benefit the State of \nHawaii  in maintaining and further advancing it\u2019s mission.  \n \nAs a former senior advisor to the Admirals, and  current Regent Emeritus and recent past Regent \non the university Board of Reg ents, I am fortunate to have a keen understanding on the \nqualifications and hiring of positions on the executive level .  Mr. Patrick H.

Ige Chair Senate Committee on Health Hawaii State Capital Room 215 415 South Beretania Street Honolulu, Hi 96813 Dear Senator Ige,        I met Rein Terrado in 2017 at Pacific Rim University (PACRIM). We studied Christian Ministry together. During our time there at the University, Rein always excelled on her coursework. I wondered how she was able to achieve her academic success? When I inquired with her about her success, I found out something that really struck me as amazing. Not only was she pursuing her Master\u2019s degree at the University, but she was also doing it while working in the Hawaii State Legislature, and raising a child with Autism. I couldn\u2019t believe her capacity to accomplish what she was doing. She expressed to me at the time how she wanted to be an advocate for children with Autism. I found out that she published a children\u2019s book, worked as a journalist in the Philippines, and was going to enroll in the more rigorous Master\u2019s in Divinity Program at PACRIM studying Greek and Hebrew. Before I left the University, I witnessed Rein complete and graduate with her Master\u2019s in Divinity. Since earning her degree, I have kept in touch with Rein and on occasion I have asked her to help me with certain problems. She is always willing and ready to help me, even with her busy schedule. I highly recommend Rein, due to her capacity to perform, her vast work experience, and her educational expertise. She also knows firsthand what it is like to be a parent of a child with Autism. She is a passionate and multi-talented professional and will be an asset to whomever and wherever she is assigned.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Warren S.

She is well versed in le nding a \nparents per spective to perti nent discussions s urround  developmental disabilities .  \n  The Council appreciates the opportunity to express our strong support for GM \n612 and GM 613  to confirm the appointment of Reinalyn Terrado to the State Council \non Developmental Disabilities.  \n  Sincer ely,  \n     \nDaintr y Barto ldus      \nExecutiv e Administrator  2223 Ho\u2019one\u2019e Place, Honolulu, HI 96819 / Tel. 808- 518-4791 / www.pacrim.edu  \n  \nFebruary 16, 2022  \nTo Whom It May Concern,  \nAs both a person and a student, Reinalyn M. Terrado was a favorite of mine because of her warm \nspirit, cooperative attitude, diligent and conscientious efforts, classroom participation, eagerness to exercise and hone her thinking skills, and desire to learn and grow.  I would have been  \noverjoyed to have all my st udents be like Rein.  She is among the top t wo or three  graduate \nstudents I have had the privilege to teach.   \nWhen Rein graduated from the university with her Master of Divinity degree, as selected by faculty, she was awarded the top honor bestowed on gr aduate students, membership in the Delta \nEpsilon Chi Honor Society.  This honor recognizes intellectual achievement, character, and leadership ability.   \nWith a special needs child, Rein is compassionate and cares about people.  She has a servant\u2019s \nheart and desires to help those in need. In my interactions with her, she is a strong advocate for \nthose who are underserved or oppressed, e specially those w ith disabilities.    \nWhile a student at the university, Rein volunteered at the Kokua Pantry (serving those in need of food and clothing) , Gala Fundraising (annual university event) , and  Sand Island Treatment \nCenter Outreach  (a long- term, residential continuum of care treatment program that takes clients \non a journey from rock- bottom to a fulfilling and meaningful life ).   \nFor her internship experiences, she served at One Love Ministries from August to December  in \n2018.  At One Love she a ssisted church staff in research, meetings, counseling, and clerical work \nduring weekday visit s and developed Sunday School lessons for the Special Needs Ministry .  \nFrom May to December of 2019, Rein served at the YMCA in Mililani assisting  neurotypical \nelementary -age students during the 2019 summer camp and assisting students with special needs \nat the Pearl City Highlands Elementary School  during the school year.     \nIn the classroom, Rein excelled. She grasped concepts q uickly and was able to apply them \ncreatively in new settings.  She actively participated in classroom exercises and would consider new ideas, think through them, and incorporate them into her perspective as appropriate.  Rein was an eager learner and highl y conscientious in completing work and assignments in a timely, \naccurate and comprehensive manner.  Rein truly was a pleasure to teach.    \nRein would be an exceptional choice for acceptance to the State Council on Developmental Disabilitie s.  She receives the strongest recommendation I can possibly provide.  Please feel free \nto contact me if you have any questions.   \nSincerely,  \nSteven Hostetter  \n(Former) President  \n(808) 200- 8424  \nTestimony for Reinalyn Terrado  \n \nSenator Keo hokalole  \n415 South Beretania St.  \nHonolulu, HI 96813  \n \nSenator Keo hokalole ,  \n I am honored to w rite a testimony to you and your distinguished committee members in  \nsupport of Reinalyn  Terrado , to be a member of the Developmental Disabilities Council. I have had the  \nprivilege of knowing Reinaly n, both on a personal and professional leve l for about f ive years. We initially  \nmet as graduate students at Pacific Rim Christian University in Honolulu. Despite being a wife and   \nmother to two young sons, Reinalyn demonstrated the fortitude to complete her studies and gra duate  \nwith two Master degrees.  \n Rein alyn\u2019s passion to achieve academic success and much of her endeavors , are inspired by her  \nyoungest son, who has Autism. Reinalyn has gained experience in helping her son to obtain the most  \neffect ive resources to obtain positive educational outcomes, despite his disability. This passion has  \nalso allowed her to be a very successful advocate as a staff member for the Hawaii Disability Rights  \nCenter.  Reaching out to families who need support in navigating the special educa tion system.  \nFinally, Reinalyn has even made time to lead a support group at One Love church. Providing em pathy  \nand encouragement to families with disabled children.  \nIn summary, I believe Reinalyn  Terrad o  is highly qualified to be a member of the Devel opmental  \nDisabilities Council. She will bring life and professional experience s that will prove beneficial to  \nDevel opmentally Disabled Individuals, their families , and respective service providers.  \nThank you for your time and attention to this testimony.  \n \nBest wishes,  \nJohn Kuwaye  \nMaster in Mental Health Counseling Degree Candidate  \nIntern at Portland, Oregon Vocational Rehabilitation   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n    \n \n    Senator David Y. Ige Chair Senate Committee on Health Hawaii State Capital Room 215 415 South Beretania Street Honolulu, Hi 96813 Dear Senator Ige,        I met Rein Terrado in 2017 at Pacific Rim University (PACRIM). We studied Christian Ministry together. During our time there at the University, Rein always excelled on her coursework. I wondered how she was able to achieve her academic success? When I inquired with her about her success, I found out something that really struck me as amazing. Not only was she pursuing her Master\u2019s degree at the University, but she was also doing it while working in the Hawaii State Legislature, and raising a child with Autism. I couldn\u2019t believe her capacity to accomplish what she was doing. She expressed to me at the time how she wanted to be an advocate for children with Autism. I found out that she published a children\u2019s book, worked as a journalist in the Philippines, and was going to enroll in the more rigorous Master\u2019s in Divinity Program at PACRIM studying Greek and Hebrew. Before I left the University, I witnessed Rein complete and graduate with her Master\u2019s in Divinity. Since earning her degree, I have kept in touch with Rein and on occasion I have asked her to help me with certain problems. She is always willing and ready to help me, even with her busy schedule. I highly recommend Rein, due to her capacity to perform, her vast work experience, and her educational expertise. She also knows firsthand what it is like to be a parent of a child with Autism. She is a passionate and multi-talented professional and will be an asset to whomever and wherever she is assigned.  Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Warren S. Gambino US ARMY  MAJOR (Ret) "},

He is personable and innovative with a \ncan-do character who inspires others. Mahalo.  \n  March 8, 2022  Aloha, Senator Glenn Wakai, Chair; Senator Bennette E. Misalucha, Vice Chair; and members of the Committee on Energy, Economic Development, and Tourism: I am writing to express my support of GM620, which submits Vincent Kimura for consideration and confirmation to the Hawaii Technology Development Corporation, for a term to expire June 30, 2024. I have known Vincent for nearly 30 years. We are friends, and have been coworkers, collaborators, and cofounders across countless projects. He has been repeatedly recognized for his leadership and expertise in Hawaii's innovation sector. Having preceded me as CEO of ag-tech startup Smart Yields, Vincent has most recently assumed a full-time role at the University of Hawaii, serving as Innovation & Technology Development Program Manager with the Office of Innovation & Commercialization. There are few positions as relevant as his in terms of growing Hawaii's tech sector and diversifying Hawaii's economy, especially given the important role UH should be playing in the broader ecosystem. Mahalo for your consideration.  Ryan Kawailani Ozawa \nRYAN KAWAILANI OZAWA P.O.

I would like to be a member of the State Board of \nPharmacy to give back to the public and our profession. Public service helps to protect all of the residents of Hawaii\n. Pharmac y \ncontinues to evolve and change and there is still alot of work to do.  I \nhope to be granted the opportunity for a second term.  \n \n(2)        What do you perceive are the roles and responsibilities of a member of the \nBoard?  \n1. Public health and safety - this is  the foremost responsibility of the \nBoard. All decisions should be focused on keeping the public safe \nthrough rules and regulations.  \n2. Understanding statutes, regulations, FDA, Controlled Substances \nAct. \n3. Granting licensure and understanding the examination p rocess \nand development.  \n4. Prepare for, attend, and participate in monthly meetings.  \n5. Legislative support - provide legislature feedback from the Board \non any bills that could affect pharmacy and public safety.              \n \n(3)        Given your understanding of the roles and responsibilities of a Board member, \nwhy do you believe that you are qualified for the position?   Please include a brief \nstatement of your skills, expertise and knowledge that would aid you as a member of the Board. 1. I consistently attend Bo ard meetings and understand the roles \nand responsibilities of Board members, as well as the meeting \nprocedures. I have completed my first term and am entering my \n2nd year as chair of the Board.  \n2. I graduated from pharmacy school in 1997 and have worked in \nmany different capacities as a community pharmacist including \npharmacy manager, pharmacy recruiter, and district pharmacy \nmanager. These different roles have given me different skills, \nknowledge, and experiences that can help advise the Board in \nvarious situ ations.  \n3. I currently work as a pharmacy manager in the community \npharmacy setting. As a front line pharmacist, I am directly affected \nby the changes and rules and can provide first -hand experience to \nBoard discussions.  \n4. I worked with the Narcotics Enforcemen t Division on many issues \nand have an understanding of their role and working relationship with the Board and pharmacies.  \n5. I worked with the Department of Health on various vaccination programs. I am the recipient of the American Pharmacist \nAssociation nati onal Immunization Champion award in 2017 for \nmy efforts with our Hepatitis A outbreak.  \n \n(4)        What do you hope to accomplish during your term of service?  \nI hope to help the profession of pharmacy maneuver the \neverchanging healthcare landscape and challenges safely. I can \nand offer insight from the community pharmacist perspective.  \n \n(5)        Name three qualities that best describe you and how these qualities will benefit \nthe Board.  \n1. Leadership experience - I have many different experiences and \nenjoy  the challenges in leadership roles.  \n2. Detail -oriented - as most pharmacists, I appreciate details and \nstrive for consistency and quality in all the work that I produce.  \n3. Compassionate - I build relationships with my patients and truly care \nabout their well -being. My priority is patients\u2019 care and the patients\u2019 \nneeds.  \n \n (6)        Name a previous experience you've had that will be beneficial as a Board \nmember.  \n1. Communication - I have participated in, and led meetings, given \ncountless presentations, and am comforta ble speaking to \ndifferent audiences as necessary. As pharmacists we are charged \nwith communication between providers, patients, colleagues, \nmanagement, and even law enforcement.  \n2. I have attended all board meetings in my first term and served as \nchair over t he last year through virtual meetings.   \n3. Volunteerism - from a very young age, I have always donated my \ntime to community service, whether it be key club projects in high school to various events with my children\u2019s school.  \n \n(7)        Can you foresee any possible conflicts of interest that could arise during your \nservice on the Board?   How would you overcome conflicts of interest?  \n \nI foresee how a possible conflict could arise if an issue comes from \nor against my employer, myself, or someone I know. In this case, \nor any case that there may be perceived conflict, I would disclose the conflict right away and ask to be excused if it is perceived or if \nI feel that I could not remain unbiased. I feel that I can remain \nneutral and hear both sides but also understand that it may not always be appropriate, should be disclosed, and can be perceived \nby the public as biased and in situations, I should ask to be \nexcused.  \n  \nTestimony of the Board of Pharmacy  \n \nBefore the  \nSenate Committee  on Commerce  and Consumer Protection   \nFriday , February 18, 2022  \n9:30 a.m. \nVia Videoconference  \n \nOn the following measure:  \nG.M. 623, SUBMITTING FOR CONSIDERATION AND CONFIMATION  \nTO THE BOARD OF PHARMACY,  \nGUBENATORIAL NOMINEE, ALANNA ISOBE,  \nFOR A TERM TO EXPIRE 6 -30-2026  \n \nChair Baker and Members of the Committee:  \n My name is Lee Ann Teshima, on behalf of James Skizewski, Executive Officer \nfor the Board of Pharmacy (Board).

I am the Director of Human Resources at 'Iolani School and \nwe have been fortunate e nough to partner with Alanna and Albertsons Companies over the \ncourse of the pandemic.  Due to Alanna's efforts, 'Iolani was able  to host over 15 \nCOVID  vaccination clinics on our campus for the Hawaii community.  Without Alanna's work \nand coordination, thi s would not have been possible.  \nAlanna is a dedicated and caring pharmacist who works tirelessly to  keep our community \nsafe.  She has a positive approach to everything she does and is truly inspiring.  I've had the \nprivilege of personally watching her work  hours upon hours at our COVID clinics -- she \nexihibits patience and empathy  to patients as young as 5 to those over 90,  making them feel \ncomfortable and cared for.  Her knowledge and expertise are  unmatched, but it's her heart and \ncommitment that truly se t her apart.     \n'Iolani has been  fortunate to work with Alanna and I know she will continue to be  a valuable \nmember of the Hawaii State Board of Pharmacy.  Thank you very much for your time and \nconsideration of this testimony.  Please feel free to contact  me at 808 -943-2315 should you have \nany questions or need any additional information.  \nSincerely,  \nStaci Fujikawa  \n  \n TESTIMONY ON GOVERNOR\u2019S MESSAGE (GM) 623  \nNOMINATION OF ALANNA ISOBE TO THE BOARD OF PHARMACY  \nBY JARED REDULLA  \n \nSENATE COMMITTEE ON COMMERCE AND CONSUMER PROTECTION \n \n \nChair Baker, Vice Chair Chang and Members of the Committee:  \n I am writing to you to express my support for the nomination of Alanna Isobe to the Hawaii Board of Pharmacy.   I support Alanna\u2019s nomination for two important reasons.  \n First, I have known Alanna for more than ten years as she was the Hawaii pharmacy \nmanager for all of the Safew ay pharmacies in our State.  Since that time, I have known \nAlanna to be one of the most professional pharmacists I have ever met.  As the Safeway pharmacy manager, Alanna always went the extra mile to ensure that Safeway was always compliant with the law; while simultaneously providing high quality service \nto patients and customers.  It was always a pleasure for me to work with her because I always knew that Safeway in Hawaii would always have their \u201cact together\u201d  with Alanna \nat the helm.   If the Committee supports Alanna\u2019s nomination, Alanna\u2019s hard work for the \nBoard of Pharmacy is assured.   \n Second, and equally important, I have always known Alanna to be a professional who \ncares deeply about the practice of pharmacy and the future of the pharmacy industry  in \nHawaii.  During the pandemic, Alanna was part of a team of pharmacists that went into the community to provide vaccinations to keiki and community members that needed access to vaccines.  Moreover, Alanna has volunteered her time to the Board already and she continues to want to make a difference in her profession and her community.   \nAlanna is an example of the high esteem that our community places in its pharmacists.   \n Finally, while I have appeared before you many times in my official capacity as a government official, I note that my testimony today is my own personal testimony and \nnot that of my department.    For the reasons listed above, I respectfully request that the Committee support Alanna\u2019s nomination for the Board of Pharmacy.  Our community will be well served with Alanna\u2019s work with the Board of Pharmacy.   \n Thank you for the opportunity to provide testimony.  \n /S/ Jared K. Redulla  \n  February 15, 2022 \nDear Committee: \nIt is my privilege to write this letter in support of Alann a Isobe\u2019s nomination to the Board of Pharmacy. I \nhave known Dr. Isobe for several years through precepting pharmacy students prior to serving with her \non the Board of Pharmacy. We are both currently on the Board of Pharmacy.  \nDr. I sobe h as extensive e xperience an d insight in t he a rea of c ommunity p harmacy.

She is the \ncurrent chair of the Board of Pharmacy  and during this time I have observed her to \nhave extensive working knowledge  of the applicable laws and rules , interest in \nexpanding community access to health care through pha rmacies and ensuring \npatient safety .  As an experienced, practicing pharmacist she also brings valuable \nknowledge and experience in the profession.   \n \nAlanna  exhibits professional ism, commitment to her community, and dedication  to \nmoving the practice of pha rmacy forward.  \n \nFor these reasons I strongly support her reappointment to the Board  of Pharmacy.  \n \nThank you for the opportunity to submit this testimony.  \n \nSincerely,  \n \nTiffany Yajima  DATE:   February 15, 2022  \n  \nTO: Senator Rosalyn Baker  \nChair, Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection  \nSubmitted Via Capitol Website  \n  \nFROM: Tiffany Yajima  \n  \nRE: GM623 - Submitting for consideration and confirmation to the Board of \nPharmacy, Gubernatorial Nominee, ALANNA ISOBE, for a term to expire 06 -\n30-2026.  \n \nHearing Date:   Friday, February 18, 2022 at 9:30 a.m. \nConference Room: 229 \n Senator  Rosalyn Baker  and Committee Members  \nSenate Committee on Commerce and Consumer Protection  \n \nI am writing in support of the nomination of Alanna Isobe  to the Board of Pharmacy.   \n \nI am a retired Supervisory Special Agent that worked for the State of Hawaii Narcotics \nEnforcement Division (NED).  I had the responsibility of overseeing the special investigations \nsection that included  pharmacy inspections and  felony i nvestigations of controlled substances  \nunder Chapter 329 of Hawaii Revised Statu tes.  As part of my duties, I was also assigned to \nattend the Board of Pharmacy meetings  as a representative of NED.  \n \nI have conducted and overseen hundreds of pharmacy inspections and felony controlled \nsubstance investigations and have worked with Miss Is obe during those operations.  She is \nprofessional and knowledgeable on all aspects of pharmacy operations and the laws that \npertain to controlled substances.  She is also very conscientious  and has the highest ethical \nstandards.  Her  leadership skills, expe rience, and critical thinking would continue to benefit the \nBoard of Pharmacy. Her  confirmation would benefit the health care community and the citizens \nof the State of Hawaii.  \n \n \nDean Yamamoto  From: Heather Caryofilles <caryofil5@gmail.com> \nSent:  Wednesday, February 16, 2022 7:09 PM  \nTo: baker4 - David <baker4@capitol.hawaii.gov>  \nSubject: Testimony for Alanna Isobe nomination\nPlease accept my highest recommendation for Alanna Isobe for the Hawaii  State \nBoard of Pharmacy. \nI have been trained by Alanna in 2 different settings in Colorado.  Both in a  retail \nsetting and in a HMO setting.  I have been in pharmacy for 28 years and  \nAlanna\u2019s level of excellence is unparalleled.   \nShe possesses both the tenacity to achieve the highest standards in all her  \nemployees and the desire to see the end goal achieved by getting her own  \nhands dirty in the process.  She is the only supervisor that I\u2019ve ever worked with  \nwho does not believe that she is exempt from working weekends or\nevenings.  Her philosophy has always been to help wherever needed.  She is  \nright there with her employees, no matter what needs to be done.   \nAlanna has an innate ability to inspire others to perform to the height of their  \nability, simply by working next to them.  It is an anomaly to work with a  \nsupervisor who is both brilliant and dedicated to greatness, leading by  example.   \nPerhaps the most distinguishing characteristic about Alanna, however, is that  \nyou would be hard pressed to find an employee of hers, past or present, who  \ndoesn\u2019t speak of her in the highest regard.  She achieves greatness without  \nundermining others. \nAlanna is a delight to work with, for, or around.  You will find her abilities in  \nleadership, ingenuity, and work ethic to be unparalleled. \nI could not recommend anyone higher for this position than Alanna Isobe. \nThank you for your time, \nHeather Caryofilles, PharmD. \nKaiser Permamente, Colorado \ncaryofil5@gmail.com"}
